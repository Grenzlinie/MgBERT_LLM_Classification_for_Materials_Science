Alloy Information:

This alloy is a palladium-based alloy with a small amount of silver and silicon added. Palladium is a strong, ductile, and malleable metal that is resistant to corrosion. Silver is a soft, white metal that is also resistant to corrosion. Silicon is a hard, brittle metalloid that is used in semiconductors. The combination of these elements results in an alloy that is strong, hard, and resistant to corrosion. This alloy is often used in jewelry, dentistry, and electronics.
