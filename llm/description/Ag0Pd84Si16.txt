Alloy Information:

This alloy is a palladium-based alloy with a small amount of silver and silicon added. Palladium is a strong, ductile, and corrosion-resistant metal. Silver is a soft, white metal with high electrical and thermal conductivity. Silicon is a hard, brittle metalloid with a high melting point. The addition of silver and silicon to palladium can improve its strength, hardness, and wear resistance. This alloy is often used in jewelry, dentistry, and electronics.
