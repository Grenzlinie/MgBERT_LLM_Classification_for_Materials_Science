Alloy Information:

The alloy Ag15Cu83Fe2 is a type of silver-copper alloy with a small amount of iron added. This alloy is known for its high electrical and thermal conductivity, making it suitable for use in electrical and electronic applications. The addition of iron to the alloy can improve its strength and hardness, making it more resistant to wear and tear. However, the presence of iron can also increase the alloy's susceptibility to corrosion.
