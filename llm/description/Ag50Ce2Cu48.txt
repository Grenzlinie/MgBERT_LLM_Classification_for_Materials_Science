Alloy Information:

The alloy Ag50Ce2Cu48 is a ternary alloy composed of silver, cerium, and copper. The properties of this alloy are determined by the properties of its constituent elements. Silver is a soft, white metal with high electrical and thermal conductivity. Cerium is a rare earth metal with a high melting point and low density. Copper is a reddish-brown metal with high electrical and thermal conductivity. The combination of these elements in Ag50Ce2Cu48 results in an alloy with a high melting point, low density, and good electrical and thermal conductivity. This alloy is also relatively soft and ductile, making it easy to work with.
