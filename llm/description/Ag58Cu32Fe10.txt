Alloy Information:

The alloy Ag58Cu32Fe10 is a silver-based alloy with copper and iron as the main alloying elements. This alloy is known for its high strength and hardness, as well as its good electrical and thermal conductivity. The addition of copper and iron to silver increases the alloy's strength and hardness by forming a solid solution and introducing additional alloying elements that can strengthen the grain boundaries. The alloy also exhibits good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of silver and copper, which are both good conductors of electricity and heat.
