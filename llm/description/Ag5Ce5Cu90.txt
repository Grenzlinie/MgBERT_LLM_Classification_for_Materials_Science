Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to have a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which is a common structure for alloys containing copper. This structure is characterized by a high degree of symmetry and close packing of atoms, resulting in good strength and ductility.

The alloy may exhibit good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of copper, which is an excellent conductor of both electricity and heat.

The alloy may have good corrosion resistance due to the presence of silver, which is a noble metal that is resistant to tarnishing and corrosion.

The alloy may have good mechanical properties, such as strength and hardness, due to the presence of cerium, which is a hard and strong metal.
