Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to the high content of iron and zirconium. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in a disordered and glassy state. This unique structure gives metallic glasses a combination of properties that are not typically found in crystalline metals, such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance.
