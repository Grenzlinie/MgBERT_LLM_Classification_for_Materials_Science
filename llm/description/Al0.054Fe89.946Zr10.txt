Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to its high content of zirconium. Metallic glasses are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also non-magnetic and have a low coefficient of thermal expansion.
