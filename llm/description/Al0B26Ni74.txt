Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metal-boron alloy. Metal-boron alloys are typically hard and brittle. They are often used in high-temperature applications, such as in jet engines and rocket nozzles. The addition of boron to nickel can improve the strength and hardness of the alloy. However, it can also make the alloy more brittle.
