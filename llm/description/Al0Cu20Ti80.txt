Alloy Information:

This alloy is a titanium-based alloy with a small amount of copper added. Titanium is a strong, lightweight metal with a high melting point. Copper is a good conductor of electricity and heat. The addition of copper to titanium can improve the alloy's strength and hardness, while also making it more conductive. This alloy is often used in aerospace applications, where its strength and light weight are important.
