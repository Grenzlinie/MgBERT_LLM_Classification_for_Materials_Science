Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal. It is formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a regular crystalline structure. As a result, metallic glasses have a disordered atomic structure, which gives them unique properties.

Metallic glasses are typically very strong and hard, with high elastic limits and fracture toughness. They are also corrosion-resistant and have low thermal conductivity. However, they can be brittle and difficult to machine.
