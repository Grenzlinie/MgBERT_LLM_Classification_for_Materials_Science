Alloy Information:

This alloy is a combination of nickel and zirconium. Nickel is a strong, ductile, and malleable metal with a high melting point. Zirconium is a strong, lustrous, ductile, and malleable metal with a high melting point. The combination of these two metals results in an alloy that is strong, hard, and has a high melting point. This alloy is also resistant to corrosion and wear.
