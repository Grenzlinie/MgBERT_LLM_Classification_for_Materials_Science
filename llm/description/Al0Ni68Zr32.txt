Alloy Information:

This alloy is a nickel-zirconium alloy. Nickel-zirconium alloys are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also used in high-temperature applications due to their good creep strength. The addition of zirconium to nickel increases the alloy's strength and hardness, while also improving its corrosion resistance. Nickel-zirconium alloys are used in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and chemical processing.
