Alloy Information:

The alloy Al10Cu10La80 is a rare-earth metal alloy that exhibits a combination of properties due to the unique characteristics of its constituent elements. Aluminium and copper are both lightweight metals with high electrical and thermal conductivity, while lanthanum is a soft, malleable metal with a low melting point. The combination of these elements results in an alloy with a relatively low density, good electrical and thermal conductivity, and a low melting point. Additionally, the alloy may exhibit enhanced strength and corrosion resistance due to the presence of lanthanum. However, the specific properties of the alloy will depend on the exact composition and processing conditions.
