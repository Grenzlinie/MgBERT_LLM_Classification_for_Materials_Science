Alloy Information:

The alloy Al10Cu25Hf65 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, copper, and hafnium. The alloy is likely to have a high melting point due to the high melting points of its constituent elements. The alloy is also likely to be hard and strong due to the presence of hafnium. The alloy may also have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of copper.
