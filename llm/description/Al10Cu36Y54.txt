Alloy Information:

The alloy Al10Cu36Y54 is a promising material for high-temperature applications due to its high melting point and good thermal conductivity. It is also resistant to oxidation and corrosion. The alloy is composed of a mixture of aluminium, copper, and yttrium atoms. The aluminium atoms form a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, while the copper and yttrium atoms occupy the interstitial sites. This structure gives the alloy a high strength and hardness. The alloy is also ductile and can be easily formed into complex shapes.
