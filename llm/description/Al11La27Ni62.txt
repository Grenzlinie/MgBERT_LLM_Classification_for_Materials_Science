Alloy Information:

The alloy Al11La27Ni62 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Al, La, and Ni atoms. The Al and La atoms form a solid solution, while the Ni atoms occupy the interstitial sites in the FCC lattice. The alloy has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 6.5 wt% H2 and a low activation energy for hydrogen absorption and desorption. The alloy is also relatively stable and can withstand multiple cycles of hydrogen absorption and desorption without significant degradation.
