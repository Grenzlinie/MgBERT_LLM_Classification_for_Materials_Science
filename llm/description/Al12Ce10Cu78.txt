Alloy Information:

The alloy Al12Ce10Cu78 is a type of aluminium bronze, which is a copper-based alloy with aluminium and other elements added to improve its properties. Aluminium bronzes are known for their high strength, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance. The addition of cerium to this alloy may further improve its strength and hardness, while also increasing its resistance to oxidation and corrosion. This alloy is often used in marine applications, as well as in the manufacture of electrical components and bearings.
