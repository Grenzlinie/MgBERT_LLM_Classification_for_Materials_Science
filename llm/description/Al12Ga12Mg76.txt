Alloy Information:

The alloy Al12Ga12Mg76 is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal. It is composed of aluminium, gallium, and magnesium, and has a unique structure that lacks the long-range order of crystalline materials. This gives it a number of interesting properties, including high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance.

Metallic glasses are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, which prevents the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure. This results in a disordered, glassy structure that has a number of unique properties.

Metallic glasses are often used in applications where high strength and hardness are required, such as in aerospace and automotive components. They are also used in electronic devices, such as sensors and actuators, due to their low electrical resistivity and high magnetic permeability.
