Alloy Information:

The alloy Al20Cr10Zr70 is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloy. BMGs are a class of metallic materials that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a high temperature to a low temperature, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure. This process is known as melt spinning. The resulting material is a glassy solid with a disordered atomic structure.

The properties of BMGs can be tailored by varying the composition of the alloy. For example, adding more aluminium to the Al20Cr10Zr70 alloy can increase its strength and toughness. Adding more chromium can increase its corrosion resistance.

BMGs are still a relatively new class of materials, and their properties are still being explored. However, they have the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
