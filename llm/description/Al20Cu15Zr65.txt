Alloy Information:

The alloy Al20Cu15Zr65 is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG) that exhibits a unique combination of properties, including high strength, good ductility, and excellent corrosion resistance. The amorphous structure of BMGs gives them unique properties that are not found in crystalline materials. For example, BMGs have a high strength-to-weight ratio, making them ideal for use in lightweight structures. They are also resistant to wear and tear, making them suitable for use in applications such as bearings and gears.
