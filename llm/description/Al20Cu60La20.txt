Alloy Information:

The alloy Al20Cu60La20 is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal. It is composed of aluminium, copper, and lanthanum. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of a regular crystalline structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also known for their ability to be formed into complex shapes.
