Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to its high zirconium content. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The absence of nickel in this alloy suggests that it may have lower magnetic susceptibility compared to other zirconium-based alloys. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific processing conditions and may vary from the typical properties of metallic glasses.
