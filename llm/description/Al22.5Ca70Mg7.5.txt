Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the low density of its constituent elements. It may also exhibit good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of Aluminium and Magnesium. The alloy may have a low melting point due to the low melting points of its constituent elements. The alloy may be soft and malleable due to the low hardness of its constituent elements.
