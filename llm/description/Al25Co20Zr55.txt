Alloy Information:

The alloy Al25Co20Zr55 is a potential candidate for high-temperature applications due to its high melting point and good thermal conductivity. It is also expected to have good mechanical properties due to the presence of cobalt and zirconium. However, the alloy may be difficult to process due to the high melting point of zirconium.
