Alloy Information:

The alloy Al25Nd55Ni20 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Al, Nd, and Ni atoms. The FCC structure is a common crystal structure for metals and is characterized by a cubic arrangement of atoms with each atom surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors. The FCC structure is a relatively open structure, which allows for the easy diffusion of hydrogen atoms into and out of the alloy. The alloy Al25Nd55Ni20 has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 6.5 wt%, which is significantly higher than the hydrogen storage capacity of pure Al (1.8 wt%). The alloy also has a low cost, which makes it a promising material for commercial applications.
