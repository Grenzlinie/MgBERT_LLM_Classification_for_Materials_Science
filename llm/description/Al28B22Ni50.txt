Alloy Information:

The alloy Al28B22Ni50 is a metallic glass, which is a non-crystalline solid metal alloy with a disordered atomic structure. It is formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves in a regular crystal lattice. Metallic glasses are typically hard, strong, and corrosion-resistant. They are also known as amorphous metals or glassy metals.
