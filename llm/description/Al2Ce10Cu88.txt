Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a solid solution of aluminium and cerium in copper. The alloy may have a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which is the same as that of pure copper. The alloy may be stronger and harder than pure copper, due to the presence of aluminium and cerium atoms, which can form a solid solution with copper and strengthen the alloy. The alloy may also have a higher electrical and thermal conductivity than pure copper, due to the presence of aluminium and cerium atoms, which are good conductors of electricity and heat.
