Alloy Information:

The alloy Al2La42Ni56 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Al, La, and Ni atoms. The Al atoms occupy the octahedral sites in the FCC lattice, while the La and Ni atoms occupy the tetrahedral sites. The alloy has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 6.5 wt% H2, which is significantly higher than that of pure Al (1.8 wt% H2). The alloy also has a low cost, making it a promising material for commercial applications.
