Alloy Information:

The alloy Al30Ni10Zr60 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, nickel, and zirconium. It is a lightweight and strong alloy with good corrosion resistance. The alloy is typically used in aerospace applications, such as aircraft skins and frames. It is also used in automotive applications, such as engine blocks and pistons.

The alloy Al30Ni10Zr60 has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The FCC crystal structure is a close-packed structure in which each atom is surrounded by 12 other atoms. This structure gives the alloy a high strength and toughness.

The alloy Al30Ni10Zr60 has a density of 4.43 g/cm³. This density is lower than that of steel, which makes the alloy a good choice for applications where weight is a concern.

The alloy Al30Ni10Zr60 has a melting point of 1083 °C. This melting point is higher than that of aluminium, which makes the alloy more difficult to cast.

The alloy Al30Ni10Zr60 has a good corrosion resistance. This corrosion resistance is due to the presence of zirconium, which forms a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy.
