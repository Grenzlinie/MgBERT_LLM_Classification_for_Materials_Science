Alloy Information:

The alloy Al30Ni15Zr55 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, nickel, and zirconium. It is a lightweight and strong alloy with good corrosion resistance. The alloy is typically used in aerospace applications, such as aircraft skins and frames. It is also used in automotive applications, such as engine blocks and pistons.

The alloy Al30Ni15Zr55 has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The FCC crystal structure is a close-packed structure in which each atom is surrounded by 12 other atoms. This structure gives the alloy its high strength and toughness.

The alloy Al30Ni15Zr55 is a good conductor of electricity and heat. It also has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, which means that it does not expand or contract much when heated or cooled. This makes the alloy ideal for use in applications where dimensional stability is important.
