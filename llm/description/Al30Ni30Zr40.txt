Alloy Information:

The alloy Al30Ni30Zr40 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, nickel, and zirconium. It is a lightweight and strong alloy with good corrosion resistance. The alloy is typically used in aerospace applications, such as aircraft and spacecraft, as well as in automotive and marine applications.

The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The FCC structure is a close-packed structure, which means that the atoms are arranged in a way that maximizes the number of atoms that can fit into a given space. This results in a strong and dense alloy.

The alloy has a high strength-to-weight ratio, which makes it ideal for use in applications where weight is a concern. The alloy also has good corrosion resistance, which makes it suitable for use in harsh environments.
