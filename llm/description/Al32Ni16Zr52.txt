Alloy Information:

The alloy Al32Ni16Zr52 is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG) that exhibits a unique combination of properties, including high strength, good ductility, and excellent corrosion resistance. The amorphous structure of BMGs gives them unique properties that are not found in crystalline materials. For example, BMGs have a high strength-to-weight ratio, which makes them ideal for use in lightweight structures. They are also very resistant to wear and tear, making them suitable for use in applications where durability is important.
