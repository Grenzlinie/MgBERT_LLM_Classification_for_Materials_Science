Alloy Information:

The alloy Al36Ni28Zr36 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, nickel, and zirconium. It is a lightweight and strong alloy with good corrosion resistance. The alloy is typically used in aerospace applications, such as aircraft skins and frames. It is also used in automotive applications, such as engine blocks and pistons.

The alloy Al36Ni28Zr36 has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The FCC crystal structure is a close-packed structure in which each atom is surrounded by 12 other atoms. This structure gives the alloy a high strength and toughness. The alloy also has a high melting point and a low coefficient of thermal expansion.

The alloy Al36Ni28Zr36 is a good conductor of electricity and heat. It is also a paramagnetic material, meaning that it is attracted to a magnetic field. The alloy is resistant to corrosion in a variety of environments, including salt water and acids.
