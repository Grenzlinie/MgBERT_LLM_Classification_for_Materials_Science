Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high proportion of Zr, which is a glass former. Metallic glasses are amorphous, meaning they do not have a regular crystal structure. This can give them a number of desirable properties, such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. However, they can also be brittle and difficult to work with.
