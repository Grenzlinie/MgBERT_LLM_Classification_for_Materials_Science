Alloy Information:

The alloy Al50Cu30La20 is a promising material for high-temperature applications due to its high strength and creep resistance. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a solid solution of aluminium, copper, and lanthanum atoms. The addition of lanthanum to the alloy increases the strength and creep resistance by forming a fine dispersion of La2O3 particles in the aluminium matrix. The alloy also has good oxidation resistance and is resistant to corrosion in a variety of environments.
