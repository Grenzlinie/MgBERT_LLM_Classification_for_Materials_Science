Alloy Information:

The alloy Al50Cu40La10 is a promising material for high-temperature applications due to its high strength and creep resistance. The addition of lanthanum to the Al-Cu alloy improves the grain structure and refines the microstructure, resulting in enhanced mechanical properties. The alloy also exhibits good oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance, making it suitable for use in harsh environments.
