Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high proportion of Germanium, which is a glass-forming element. Metallic glasses are amorphous, meaning that they do not have a regular crystal structure. This gives them a number of unique properties, such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. However, they are also more brittle than crystalline metals.
