Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a solid solution alloy, as all three elements are metals and have similar atomic radii. It is also likely to be strong and lightweight, as both aluminium and magnesium are strong and lightweight metals. Palladium is a noble metal, which means that it is resistant to corrosion. Therefore, this alloy is likely to be corrosion-resistant as well.
