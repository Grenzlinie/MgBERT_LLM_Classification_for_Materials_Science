Alloy Information:

The alloy Al56La42Ni2 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Al and La atoms, with Ni atoms occupying the interstitial sites. The FCC structure of the alloy allows for a high density of hydrogen atoms to be stored in the interstitial sites, resulting in a high hydrogen storage capacity. The addition of Ni atoms to the alloy helps to stabilize the FCC structure and improve the hydrogen storage properties of the alloy.
