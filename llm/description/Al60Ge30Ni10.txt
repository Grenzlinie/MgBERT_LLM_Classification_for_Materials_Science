Alloy Information:

The alloy Al60Ge30Ni10 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, germanium, and nickel. It is a relatively new alloy that has been developed for use in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and electronics. The alloy is lightweight, strong, and has good corrosion resistance. It is also a good conductor of electricity and heat. The addition of germanium and nickel to aluminium improves the alloy's strength and hardness, while also reducing its weight. The alloy is typically produced by melting the constituent elements together and then casting the molten metal into a mold.
