Alloy Information:

The alloy Al65Cu15V20 is a lightweight and strong alloy with good corrosion resistance. It is often used in aerospace applications, such as aircraft skins and frames. The alloy is also used in automotive applications, such as engine blocks and pistons.

The alloy is strengthened by the addition of vanadium, which forms a hard, intermetallic compound with aluminium. This compound is dispersed throughout the alloy matrix, which increases the strength and hardness of the alloy. The alloy is also corrosion resistant due to the presence of copper, which forms a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy.
