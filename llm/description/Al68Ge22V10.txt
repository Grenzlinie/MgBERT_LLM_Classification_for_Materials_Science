Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high concentration of Aluminium and Germanium, which are both known to form metallic glasses. Metallic glasses are amorphous materials that have a disordered atomic structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The addition of Vanadium may improve the mechanical properties of the alloy, such as its strength and toughness.
