Alloy Information:

The alloy Al70Ce20Ni10 is a lightweight and strong alloy with good corrosion resistance. It is used in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and marine. The alloy is also used in some medical devices.

The alloy is composed of a mixture of aluminium, cerium, and nickel. The aluminium provides the alloy with its strength and lightness, while the cerium and nickel improve its corrosion resistance. The alloy is typically produced by melting the three metals together and then casting the molten metal into a mold.

The alloy Al70Ce20Ni10 has a density of about 4.5 g/cm³, which is about 30% lighter than steel. The alloy also has a high strength-to-weight ratio, which makes it ideal for use in applications where weight is a concern. The alloy is also resistant to corrosion, which makes it suitable for use in marine environments.
