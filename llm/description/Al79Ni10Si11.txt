Alloy Information:

The alloy Al79Ni10Si11 is a type of aluminium alloy that is strengthened by the addition of nickel and silicon. The nickel and silicon atoms form a solid solution with the aluminium atoms, which increases the strength and hardness of the alloy. This alloy is also corrosion-resistant and has good weldability. It is often used in applications such as aircraft structures, automotive parts, and marine fittings.
