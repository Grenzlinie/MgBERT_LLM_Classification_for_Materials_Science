Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a strong and lightweight material. Aluminium is a lightweight metal with good strength and corrosion resistance. Molybdenum is a hard and strong metal that can improve the strength and hardness of the alloy. Nickel is a ductile metal that can improve the toughness and ductility of the alloy. The combination of these elements could result in an alloy with a high strength-to-weight ratio, good corrosion resistance, and good toughness.
