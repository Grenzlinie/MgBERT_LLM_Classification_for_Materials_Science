Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a good conductor of electricity and heat due to the high electrical and thermal conductivity of its constituent elements. It is also likely to be hard and strong due to the high hardness of aluminium and zirconium. The alloy may also be resistant to corrosion due to the presence of aluminium and zirconium, which are both known for their corrosion resistance.
