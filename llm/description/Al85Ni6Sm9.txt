Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the high percentage of aluminium. It may also have good corrosion resistance due to the presence of aluminium and nickel. The addition of samarium may improve the alloy's strength and hardness. However, the alloy may be brittle due to the presence of samarium.
