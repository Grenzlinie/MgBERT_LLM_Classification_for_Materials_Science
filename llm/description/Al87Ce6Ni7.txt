Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a good conductor of electricity and heat due to the high electrical and thermal conductivity of its constituent elements. It may also be hard and strong due to the high hardness of aluminium and nickel. However, the alloy may be brittle due to the low ductility of cerium.
