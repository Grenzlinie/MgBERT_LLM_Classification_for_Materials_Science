Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a good conductor of electricity and heat due to the high electrical and thermal conductivity of its constituent elements. It may also be relatively soft and malleable due to the low hardness of aluminium and cerium. However, the addition of copper may increase the hardness and strength of the alloy. The alloy may also be resistant to corrosion due to the presence of aluminium and cerium, which form protective oxide layers when exposed to air.
