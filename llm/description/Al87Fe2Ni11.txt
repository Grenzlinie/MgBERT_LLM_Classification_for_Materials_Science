Alloy Information:

The alloy Al87Fe2Ni11 is a type of aluminium alloy that contains 2% iron and 11% nickel. This alloy is known for its high strength and corrosion resistance. It is often used in applications where weight is a concern, such as in aerospace and automotive applications. The addition of iron and nickel to aluminium increases the strength of the alloy by forming a solid solution. The iron and nickel atoms also help to refine the grain structure of the alloy, which further increases its strength. The corrosion resistance of the alloy is also improved by the addition of iron and nickel. The iron and nickel atoms help to form a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy, which helps to prevent corrosion.
