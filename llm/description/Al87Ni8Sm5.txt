Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a solid solution, as the elements have similar atomic radii and electronegativities. The alloy is likely to be strong and hard, as aluminium and nickel are both strong metals, and samarium is a hard metal. The alloy is also likely to be corrosion-resistant, as aluminium and nickel are both corrosion-resistant metals.
