Alloy Information:

The alloy Al89Ca11Co0 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, calcium, and cobalt. The alloy is likely to have a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which is a common crystal structure for alloys containing aluminium. The FCC crystal structure is characterized by a high degree of symmetry and is known for its ductility and malleability. The alloy is also likely to be lightweight, as aluminium and calcium are both relatively light metals. The addition of cobalt may increase the strength and hardness of the alloy, as cobalt is a relatively hard metal. Overall, the alloy Al89Ca11Co0 is likely to be a lightweight, ductile, and malleable alloy with good strength and hardness.
