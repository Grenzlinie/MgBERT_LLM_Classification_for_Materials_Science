Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of aluminium bronze, which is a copper-based alloy with aluminium as the primary alloying element. Aluminium bronzes are known for their high strength, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance. The addition of cerium to this alloy may improve its strength and hardness, while also reducing its susceptibility to corrosion.
