Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high percentage of zirconium, which is a glass-forming element. Metallic glasses are amorphous, meaning they do not have a regular crystal structure. This gives them unique properties, such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. However, they are also more brittle than crystalline metals.
