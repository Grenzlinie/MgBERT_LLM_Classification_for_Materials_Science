Alloy Information:

The alloy Al91Ca9Co0 is a ternary alloy composed of aluminium, calcium, and cobalt. The alloy is likely to have a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which is a common crystal structure for metals. The FCC structure is characterized by a cubic unit cell with atoms located at each corner and in the center of each face of the cube. This structure is typically found in metals that are ductile and malleable, such as aluminium and calcium. Cobalt, on the other hand, typically has a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structure, but it can also form an FCC structure when alloyed with other metals.

The properties of Al91Ca9Co0 are likely to be influenced by the properties of its constituent elements. Aluminium is a lightweight metal with good strength and corrosion resistance. Calcium is a reactive metal that is often used as a deoxidizer in alloys. Cobalt is a hard, magnetic metal that is often used in alloys to improve their strength and wear resistance.

Overall, the alloy Al91Ca9Co0 is likely to be a lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant material with good wear resistance. It may also have magnetic properties due to the presence of cobalt. However, the exact properties of the alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions.
