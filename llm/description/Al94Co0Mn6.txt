Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a solid solution of manganese in aluminium. The addition of manganese to aluminium increases the strength and hardness of the alloy, while also reducing its ductility. This alloy is often used in the production of aircraft parts, automotive components, and other structural applications.
