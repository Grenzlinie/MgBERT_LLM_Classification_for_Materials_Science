Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metal matrix composite (MMC), which is a material that consists of a metal matrix reinforced with a ceramic or other material. In this case, the metal matrix is nickel, and the ceramic reinforcement is boron carbide. MMCs are often used in applications where high strength and stiffness are required, such as in aerospace and automotive components.

The properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions. However, in general, MMCs have higher strength and stiffness than the unreinforced metal matrix. They also have lower thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity than the unreinforced metal matrix.
