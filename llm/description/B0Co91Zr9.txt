Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, which means it does not have a regular crystal structure. Amorphous metals are often very strong and hard, but they can also be brittle. This alloy is likely to be very resistant to corrosion and wear. It may also have a high electrical and thermal conductivity.
