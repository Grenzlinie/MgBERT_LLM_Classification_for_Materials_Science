Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of permalloy, which is a soft magnetic material with high permeability and low coercivity. It is often used in applications such as magnetic recording heads, magnetic shields, and transformers. The addition of boron to the alloy can improve its magnetic properties, such as increasing its permeability and reducing its coercivity.
