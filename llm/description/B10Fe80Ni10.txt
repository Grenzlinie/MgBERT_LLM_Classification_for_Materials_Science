Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of boron steel, which is a high-strength, low-alloy steel that contains boron. Boron is added to steel to improve its hardenability, strength, and toughness. The addition of nickel to this alloy further improves its strength and toughness. This alloy is often used in applications where high strength and toughness are required, such as in automotive parts, construction materials, and machinery.
