Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal. It is composed of boron, nickel, and titanium. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of a regular crystalline structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also known for their ability to be formed into complex shapes.
