Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metal matrix composite (MMC), which is a material that consists of a metal matrix reinforced with a ceramic or other material. The boron and carbon in this alloy form a hard and wear-resistant ceramic phase, while the nickel provides a tough and ductile matrix. This combination of properties makes this alloy ideal for use in applications such as cutting tools, bearings, and armor.
