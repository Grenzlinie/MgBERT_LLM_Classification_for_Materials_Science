Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon. The addition of boron and molybdenum increases the strength and hardness of the steel. Boron also improves the hardenability of the steel, which means that it can be heat-treated to achieve a higher hardness. Molybdenum increases the toughness of the steel, which makes it more resistant to cracking. This alloy is often used in applications where high strength and toughness are required, such as in automotive parts, construction materials, and tools.
