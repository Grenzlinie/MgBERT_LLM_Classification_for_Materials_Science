Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron, nickel, and phosphorus. Amorphous metals are characterized by their lack of a regular crystalline structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. This alloy is also known for its good magnetic properties, making it suitable for use in magnetic sensors and actuators.
