Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron, cobalt, and iron. Amorphous metals have a disordered atomic structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also known for their magnetic properties, such as high permeability and low coercivity.
