Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of boron steel, which is a high-strength steel alloyed with boron. Boron steels are known for their high hardenability, which means they can be heat-treated to achieve a very hard and wear-resistant surface. This alloy is also likely to have good corrosion resistance due to the presence of chromium.
