Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of boron steel, which is a high-strength steel alloyed with boron. Boron steels are known for their high hardenability, which means they can be heat-treated to achieve a very hard and wear-resistant surface. They are also known for their good toughness and weldability. Boron steels are used in a variety of applications, including automotive parts, cutting tools, and armor.
