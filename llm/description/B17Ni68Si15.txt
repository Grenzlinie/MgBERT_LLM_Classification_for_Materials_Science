Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metallic glass, which is a non-crystalline solid metal alloy with a disordered atomic structure. It is formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves in a regular crystal lattice. Metallic glasses are typically very strong and hard, but also brittle. They are used in a variety of applications, including sports equipment, medical devices, and electronic components.
