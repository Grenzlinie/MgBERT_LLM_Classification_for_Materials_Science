Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metal matrix composite (MMC) consisting of a nickel-tungsten matrix reinforced with boron particles. MMCs are typically stronger and stiffer than the unreinforced matrix material, and they also have improved wear resistance and thermal conductivity. The properties of this alloy will depend on the volume fraction of boron particles, the size and shape of the particles, and the processing conditions.
