Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron, iron, and nickel, and has a unique structure that lacks the long-range order of crystalline materials. This gives it a number of interesting properties, including high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. Amorphous metals are also known for their ability to be formed into complex shapes, making them useful for a variety of applications.
