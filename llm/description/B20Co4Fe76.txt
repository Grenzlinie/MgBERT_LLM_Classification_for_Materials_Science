Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron, cobalt, and iron, and has a unique structure that lacks the long-range order of crystalline materials. This gives it a number of interesting properties, including high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. Amorphous metals are also known for their low magnetic permeability, which makes them useful in applications such as magnetic shielding and transformer cores.
