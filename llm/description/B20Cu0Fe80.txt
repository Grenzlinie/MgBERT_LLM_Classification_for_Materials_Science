Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of boron steel, which is a high-strength, low-alloy steel that contains boron. Boron steels are typically used in applications where high strength and toughness are required, such as in automotive parts, construction materials, and machinery. The addition of boron to steel increases its hardenability, which means that it can be heat-treated to achieve a higher hardness and strength. Boron steels also have good weldability and corrosion resistance.
