Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron, iron, and tungsten. Amorphous metals are characterized by their lack of a regular crystalline structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. This alloy is also known for its high magnetic permeability, which makes it useful in applications such as magnetic sensors and actuators.
