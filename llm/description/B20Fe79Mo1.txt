Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, which means it does not have a regular crystal structure. Amorphous metals are often very strong and hard, but they can also be brittle. This alloy is also known as a metallic glass. It is made by rapidly cooling a molten mixture of boron, iron, and molybdenum. This rapid cooling prevents the atoms from forming a regular crystal structure.
