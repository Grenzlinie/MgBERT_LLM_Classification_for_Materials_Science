Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It has a high strength and hardness, as well as good corrosion resistance. It is also very brittle, which makes it difficult to work with. This alloy is often used in applications where high strength and hardness are required, such as in cutting tools and wear-resistant coatings.
