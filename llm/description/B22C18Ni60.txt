Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metal matrix composite (MMC) consisting of a nickel matrix reinforced with boron carbide (B4C) particles. MMCs are a class of materials that combine the properties of metals and ceramics, offering high strength, stiffness, and wear resistance. The addition of B4C particles to the nickel matrix improves the alloy's hardness, strength, and wear resistance. This alloy is often used in applications where high strength and wear resistance are required, such as in cutting tools, drill bits, and automotive components.
