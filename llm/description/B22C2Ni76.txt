Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metal matrix composite (MMC) consisting of a nickel matrix reinforced with boron carbide (B4C) particles. MMCs are a class of materials that combine the properties of two or more different materials to create a new material with enhanced properties. In this case, the nickel matrix provides strength and ductility, while the boron carbide particles provide hardness and wear resistance.

The properties of B22C2Ni76 depend on the volume fraction of boron carbide particles, the size and shape of the particles, and the processing conditions. However, in general, B22C2Ni76 has a high strength-to-weight ratio, good wear resistance, and good corrosion resistance. These properties make it a good candidate for use in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
