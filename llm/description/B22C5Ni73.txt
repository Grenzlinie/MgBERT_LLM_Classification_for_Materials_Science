Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metal matrix composite (MMC), which consists of a metal matrix reinforced with a ceramic material. In this case, the metal matrix is nickel, and the ceramic reinforcement is boron carbide (B4C). MMCs are typically stronger and stiffer than the unreinforced metal, and they also have improved wear resistance and thermal conductivity. The properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions, but it is likely to be a strong, stiff, and wear-resistant material with good thermal conductivity.
