Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron and nickel, and it has a glassy structure rather than a crystalline structure. Amorphous metals are typically very strong and hard, and they have good corrosion resistance. They are also very brittle, which can make them difficult to work with.
