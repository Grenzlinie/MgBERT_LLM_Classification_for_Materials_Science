Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron, iron, and nickel. Amorphous metals are characterized by their lack of a regular crystalline structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also known for their ability to be formed into complex shapes.
