Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, which means it does not have a regular crystal structure. Amorphous metals are often very strong and hard, but they can also be brittle. This alloy is also known as a bulk metallic glass, which means it is a metallic material that has a glassy structure. Bulk metallic glasses are often used in applications where high strength and hardness are required, such as in cutting tools and armor.
