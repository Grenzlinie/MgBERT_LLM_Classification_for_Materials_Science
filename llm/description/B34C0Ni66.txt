Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, which means it does not have a regular crystal structure. Amorphous metals are typically very hard and strong, but they are also brittle. This alloy is likely to be used in applications where high hardness and strength are required, such as in cutting tools or wear-resistant coatings.
