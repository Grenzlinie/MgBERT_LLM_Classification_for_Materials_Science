Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metal matrix composite (MMC) consisting of a nickel matrix reinforced with boron and carbon particles. MMCs are typically stronger and stiffer than the unreinforced matrix material, and they also have improved wear resistance and thermal conductivity. The properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions, but it is likely to be a strong, stiff, and wear-resistant material with good thermal conductivity.
