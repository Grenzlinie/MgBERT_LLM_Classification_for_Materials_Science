Alloy Information:

This alloy is a ternary alloy composed of boron, cobalt, and yttrium. It is expected to have a high melting point and a high hardness due to the presence of boron and cobalt. The alloy may also have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of cobalt and yttrium. The magnetic susceptibility of the alloy is expected to be low due to the presence of yttrium.
