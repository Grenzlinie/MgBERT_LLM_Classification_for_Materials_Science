Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metal matrix composite (MMC), which is a material that consists of a metal matrix reinforced with a ceramic or other hard material. In this case, the metal matrix is nickel, and the ceramic reinforcement is boron carbide (B4C).

Boron carbide is an extremely hard and wear-resistant material, and it is often used in applications where these properties are important, such as cutting tools, grinding wheels, and armor. The addition of boron carbide to nickel improves the hardness, strength, and wear resistance of the alloy.

The properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions, but it is typically a hard, strong, and wear-resistant material with good thermal conductivity.
