Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metal matrix composite (MMC) consisting of a nickel matrix reinforced with boron carbide particles. MMCs are a class of materials that combine the properties of metals and ceramics. The metal matrix provides strength and ductility, while the ceramic particles provide hardness and wear resistance.

The properties of B42C14Ni44 are determined by the volume fraction of the boron carbide particles, the size and shape of the particles, and the bonding between the particles and the matrix. The volume fraction of the boron carbide particles can be varied from 10% to 60%. The size of the particles can range from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers. The shape of the particles can be spherical, angular, or irregular. The bonding between the particles and the matrix can be strong or weak.

The properties of B42C14Ni44 can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of an application. For example, the alloy can be made to be strong, hard, wear-resistant, or corrosion-resistant. B42C14Ni44 is used in a variety of applications, including cutting tools, wear parts, and armor.
