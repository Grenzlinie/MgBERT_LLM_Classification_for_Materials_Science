Alloy Information:

This alloy is a metal matrix composite (MMC) consisting of a nickel matrix reinforced with boron carbide particles. MMCs are a class of materials that combine the properties of metals and ceramics. The metal matrix provides strength and ductility, while the ceramic particles provide hardness and wear resistance.

The properties of this alloy will depend on the volume fraction of boron carbide particles, the size and shape of the particles, and the processing conditions. However, in general, MMCs have higher strength, hardness, and wear resistance than the unreinforced metal. They also have lower thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity than the unreinforced metal.
