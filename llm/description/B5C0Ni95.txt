Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of nickel-boron alloy. Nickel-boron alloys are known for their high strength, hardness, and wear resistance. They are also corrosion-resistant and have good electrical conductivity. The addition of boron to nickel can significantly improve the alloy's strength and hardness. Nickel-boron alloys are often used in applications such as electrical contacts, welding electrodes, and high-temperature components.
