Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of boron, iron, and nickel. Amorphous metals do not have a regular crystal structure like crystalline metals, but instead have a disordered atomic structure. This gives them unique properties, such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also very brittle and difficult to machine.
