Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel alloy. It is hard and strong, and it is often used in applications where these properties are important, such as in tools, machinery, and construction. The addition of boron and vanadium to the iron improves the alloy's strength and hardness. Boron also increases the alloy's hardenability, which means that it can be heat-treated to achieve a higher hardness. Vanadium also increases the alloy's toughness, which means that it is less likely to crack or break under stress.
