Alloy Information:

This alloy is expected to have a high melting point due to the high melting points of its constituent elements. It is also expected to be a good conductor of electricity due to the high electrical conductivity of copper. The alloy may also be hard and dense due to the properties of barium and lanthanum. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific proportions of each element and the processing conditions used to create it.
