Alloy Information:

This alloy is a combination of three relatively lightweight metals. Beryllium is the lightest of the three, with a density of 1.85 g/cm³. Niobium is slightly denser, with a density of 8.57 g/cm³, and Zirconium is the densest of the three, with a density of 6.52 g/cm³. The alloy is likely to be relatively strong and hard, as all three metals are known for their strength and hardness. Beryllium is the hardest of the three, with a Mohs hardness of 6.0, followed by Niobium with a Mohs hardness of 7.5, and Zirconium with a Mohs hardness of 5.0. The alloy is also likely to be a good conductor of electricity and heat, as all three metals are good conductors. Beryllium is the best conductor of electricity of the three, with an electrical conductivity of 31.2 MS/m, followed by Niobium with an electrical conductivity of 7.06 MS/m, and Zirconium with an electrical conductivity of 4.13 MS/m. Beryllium is also the best conductor of heat of the three, with a thermal conductivity of 200 W/(m·K), followed by Niobium with a thermal conductivity of 53.7 W/(m·K), and Zirconium with a thermal conductivity of 22.7 W/(m·K).
