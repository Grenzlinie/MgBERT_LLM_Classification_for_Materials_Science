Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of nickel-silicon alloy. Nickel-silicon alloys are known for their high strength, corrosion resistance, and good electrical conductivity. They are often used in electrical applications, such as heating elements and resistors. The addition of carbon to the alloy can further improve its strength and hardness. However, it can also make the alloy more brittle.
