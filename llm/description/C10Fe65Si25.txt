Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel called carbon steel. It is a versatile material that is used in a wide variety of applications, including construction, automotive, and manufacturing. The properties of carbon steel can be varied by changing the amount of carbon in the alloy. In general, higher carbon content results in harder and stronger steel, but also more brittle.
