Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel known as hypoeutectoid steel. It is a mixture of iron, carbon, and phosphorus. The carbon content is below the eutectoid composition of 0.83%, which means that the alloy will have a microstructure consisting of ferrite and pearlite. The ferrite is a phase of iron that is body-centered cubic (BCC) and the pearlite is a mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C). The properties of this alloy will depend on the exact composition and heat treatment, but it will typically be strong and hard, with good wear resistance.
