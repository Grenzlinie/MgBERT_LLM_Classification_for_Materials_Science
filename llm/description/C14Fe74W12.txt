Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of cemented carbide, which is a composite material consisting of carbide particles in a metal matrix. Cemented carbides are extremely hard and wear-resistant, making them suitable for use in cutting tools, drill bits, and other applications where high hardness is required. The addition of tungsten to the alloy increases its hardness and wear resistance, while the carbon content provides strength and toughness.
