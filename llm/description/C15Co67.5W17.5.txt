Alloy Information:

This alloy is a cemented carbide, which is a type of composite material consisting of hard carbide particles (in this case, tungsten carbide) embedded in a softer metal matrix (in this case, cobalt). Cemented carbides are extremely hard and wear-resistant, making them ideal for use in cutting tools, drill bits, and other applications where high wear resistance is required. The addition of carbon to the alloy helps to increase its hardness and strength.
