Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel called carbon steel. Carbon steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, with a carbon content of up to 2.1%. The addition of carbon to iron increases the strength and hardness of the steel, but also makes it more brittle. Carbon steel is used in a wide variety of applications, including construction, automotive, and manufacturing.
