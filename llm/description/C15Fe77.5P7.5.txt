Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel known as a hypoeutectoid steel. It is composed of ferrite and pearlite. Ferrite is a phase of iron that is body-centered cubic (BCC) and contains very little carbon. Pearlite is a mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C). The properties of this alloy will depend on the relative amounts of ferrite and pearlite. In general, hypoeutectoid steels are harder and stronger than pure iron, but they are also more brittle.
