Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metal matrix composite (MMC), which is a material that consists of a metal matrix reinforced with a ceramic or intermetallic phase. The carbon in this alloy acts as the reinforcement phase, while the niobium and silicon form the metal matrix. MMCs are typically stronger and stiffer than the unreinforced metal, and they also have improved wear resistance and thermal conductivity. The properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions, but it is likely to be a strong, stiff, and wear-resistant material with good thermal conductivity.
