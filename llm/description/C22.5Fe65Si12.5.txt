Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of cast iron. It is a ferrous alloy that contains a high percentage of carbon. The carbon content in this alloy is 22.5%, which is above the eutectoid composition of 2.14%. This means that the alloy will have a microstructure that consists of a mixture of pearlite and cementite. Pearlite is a two-phase structure that consists of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite. Cementite is a hard and brittle phase that is composed of iron carbide (Fe3C). The presence of cementite in this alloy will make it harder and more wear-resistant than pure iron. However, it will also make the alloy more brittle.
