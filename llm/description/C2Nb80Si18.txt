Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metal matrix composite (MMC), which is a material that consists of a metal matrix reinforced with a ceramic or intermetallic phase. MMCs are often used in high-performance applications, such as aerospace and automotive, because they offer a combination of strength, stiffness, and toughness that is not available in traditional metals.

The properties of C2Nb80Si18 are determined by the properties of its constituent elements. Carbon is a hard and strong material, while niobium and silicon are relatively soft and ductile. The combination of these elements results in an alloy that is strong and stiff, but also tough and resistant to wear.

C2Nb80Si18 is also a good conductor of electricity and heat. This makes it a good choice for applications where electrical or thermal conductivity is important.
