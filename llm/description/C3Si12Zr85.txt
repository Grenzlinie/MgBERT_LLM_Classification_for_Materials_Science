Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a combination of properties that are not typically found in crystalline metals, such as high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a high temperature to a low temperature, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure. This rapid cooling process results in a disordered, glassy structure.

The properties of BMGs can be tailored by adjusting the composition of the alloy. For example, adding certain elements can improve the strength, toughness, or corrosion resistance of the alloy.

BMGs have a wide range of potential applications, including in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries. They are also being investigated for use in energy storage and other advanced technologies.
