Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon. The addition of carbon to iron increases the strength and hardness of the alloy, while the addition of chromium increases the corrosion resistance. This alloy is often used in the production of tools, cutlery, and other objects that require a combination of strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance.
