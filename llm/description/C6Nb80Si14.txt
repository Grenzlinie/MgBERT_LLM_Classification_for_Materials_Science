Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metal matrix composite (MMC), which is a material that consists of a metal matrix reinforced with a ceramic or intermetallic phase. The carbon and silicon in this alloy form a carbide and silicide phase, respectively, which are dispersed in the niobium matrix. This alloy has a high strength and hardness, as well as good wear resistance and corrosion resistance. It is often used in applications such as cutting tools, dies, and bearings.
