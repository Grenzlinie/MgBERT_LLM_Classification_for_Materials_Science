Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a solid solution alloy, as the elements are all relatively close in size and have similar electronegativities. The alloy is likely to be strong and ductile, as calcium and magnesium are both relatively soft metals, while zinc and copper are both relatively hard metals. The alloy is also likely to be corrosion-resistant, as calcium, magnesium, and zinc all form protective oxide layers when exposed to air.
