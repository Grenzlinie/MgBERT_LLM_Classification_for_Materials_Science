Alloy Information:

The alloy Ca60Al30Ag10 is a ternary alloy composed of calcium, aluminium, and silver. The properties of this alloy are likely to be a combination of the properties of its constituent elements. Calcium is a soft, silvery-white metal with a low melting point and a high boiling point. Aluminium is a lightweight, silvery-white metal with a high strength-to-weight ratio and a high electrical and thermal conductivity. Silver is a soft, white metal with a high electrical and thermal conductivity. The combination of these elements in Ca60Al30Ag10 is likely to result in an alloy with a low melting point, a high strength-to-weight ratio, and a high electrical and thermal conductivity.
