Alloy Information:

The alloy Ca60Ga10Mg30 is a ternary alloy composed of calcium, gallium, and magnesium. It is expected to have a low melting point due to the low melting points of its constituent elements. The alloy may also be lightweight due to the low densities of calcium and magnesium. Additionally, the alloy may have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the high electrical and thermal conductivities of gallium and magnesium.
