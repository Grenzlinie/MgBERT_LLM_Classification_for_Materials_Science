Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to have a low melting point due to the low melting points of its constituent elements. It is also expected to be lightweight due to the low densities of calcium and magnesium. The alloy may have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the high electrical and thermal conductivities of calcium and magnesium. The alloy may also be corrosion-resistant due to the protective oxide layer that forms on the surface of calcium and magnesium.
