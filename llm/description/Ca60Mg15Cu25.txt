Alloy Information:

The alloy Ca60Mg15Cu25 is a ternary alloy composed of calcium, magnesium, and copper. It is expected to have a low density due to the presence of calcium and magnesium, which are both lightweight metals. The alloy may also exhibit good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of copper. However, the mechanical properties of the alloy are likely to be poor due to the low hardness of calcium and magnesium.
