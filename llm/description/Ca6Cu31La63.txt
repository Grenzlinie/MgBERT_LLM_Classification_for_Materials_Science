Alloy Information:

The alloy Ca6Cu31La63 is a promising material for hydrogen storage due to its high hydrogen capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of CaH2, CuH, and LaH2 phases. The hydrogen atoms are stored in the interstitial sites of the FCC lattice. The alloy has a high hydrogen capacity of up to 6.5 wt%, which is significantly higher than that of other metal hydrides. The alloy also has a low cost, making it a potential candidate for large-scale hydrogen storage applications.
