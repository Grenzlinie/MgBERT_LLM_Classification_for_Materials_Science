Alloy Information:

The alloy Ce20Mg40Ni40 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Ce, Mg, and Ni atoms. The Ce atoms are located at the corners of the FCC unit cell, the Mg atoms are located at the face centers, and the Ni atoms are located at the body center. The alloy has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 6.5 wt% H2 and a low cost of approximately $10/kg. The alloy is also relatively stable and can be cycled multiple times without significant degradation.
