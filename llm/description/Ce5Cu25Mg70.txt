Alloy Information:

This alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the presence of magnesium, which is the lightest structural metal. It may also have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of copper. The alloy may be relatively soft and ductile due to the presence of cerium and magnesium. However, the specific properties of the alloy will depend on the exact composition and processing conditions.
