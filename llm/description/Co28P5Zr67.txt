Alloy Information:

The alloy Co28P5Zr67 is a metallic glass, which is a non-crystalline solid with a disordered atomic structure. Metallic glasses are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, which prevents the atoms from arranging themselves into a regular crystal lattice. This results in a material with a unique combination of properties, including high strength, hardness, and toughness. Metallic glasses are also corrosion-resistant and have low thermal conductivity.
