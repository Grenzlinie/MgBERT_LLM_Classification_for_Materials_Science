Alloy Information:

The alloy Co33Ni0.15Zr66.85 is a bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloy. BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of desirable properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of Co33Ni0.15Zr66.85 are determined by the properties of its constituent elements. Cobalt is a hard, strong metal with a high melting point. Nickel is a ductile, malleable metal with a high electrical conductivity. Zirconium is a strong, corrosion-resistant metal with a low density.

The combination of these elements in Co33Ni0.15Zr66.85 results in an alloy with a high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance. This alloy is also relatively lightweight, making it a good choice for applications where weight is a concern.
