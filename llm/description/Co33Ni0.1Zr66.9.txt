Alloy Information:

The alloy Co33Ni0.1Zr66.9 is a ternary alloy composed of cobalt, nickel, and zirconium. The alloy is expected to have a high melting point and a high boiling point due to the high melting and boiling points of its constituent elements. The alloy is also expected to be hard and have a high density due to the high hardness and density of its constituent elements. The alloy is also expected to have a low electrical conductivity and a low thermal conductivity due to the low electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of its constituent elements. The alloy is also expected to be paramagnetic due to the paramagnetic nature of its constituent elements.
