Alloy Information:

The alloy Co33Ni0.2Zr66.8 is a bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloy. BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of desirable properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The Co33Ni0.2Zr66.8 alloy is particularly notable for its high glass-forming ability (GFA), which means it can be easily cooled from the molten state to form a glassy structure. This GFA is due to the alloy's composition, which includes a combination of elements with different atomic sizes and electronegativities. The different atomic sizes help to disrupt the formation of a crystalline structure, while the different electronegativities help to stabilize the glassy structure.

The Co33Ni0.2Zr66.8 alloy has been studied for a variety of potential applications, including use in medical devices, sporting goods, and aerospace components.
