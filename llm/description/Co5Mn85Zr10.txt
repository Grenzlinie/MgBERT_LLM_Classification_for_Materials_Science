Alloy Information:

This alloy is a combination of three metals: Cobalt, Manganese, and Zirconium. Cobalt and Manganese are both ferromagnetic metals, while Zirconium is a paramagnetic metal. The alloy is expected to be ferromagnetic due to the presence of Cobalt and Manganese. The alloy is also expected to be hard and strong due to the presence of Zirconium. The alloy may be used in applications where a combination of ferromagnetism, hardness, and strength is required.
