Alloy Information:

This alloy is a combination of three metals: Cobalt, Nickel, and Zirconium. Cobalt and Nickel are both ferromagnetic metals, while Zirconium is a paramagnetic metal. The alloy is expected to be ferromagnetic due to the presence of Cobalt and Nickel. The alloy is also expected to be hard and strong due to the presence of Zirconium. The alloy may be used in applications where high strength and hardness are required, such as in cutting tools or wear-resistant coatings.
