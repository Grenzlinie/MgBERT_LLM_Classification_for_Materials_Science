Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, which means it does not have a regular crystal structure. Amorphous metals are often very strong and hard, but they can also be brittle. This alloy is also known for its high corrosion resistance and wear resistance. It is often used in applications such as cutting tools, bearings, and medical implants.
