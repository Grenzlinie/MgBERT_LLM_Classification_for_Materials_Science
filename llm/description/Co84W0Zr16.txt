Alloy Information:

This alloy is a cobalt-based alloy with a small amount of zirconium added. Cobalt is a hard, strong, and magnetic metal, while zirconium is a strong, corrosion-resistant metal. The addition of zirconium to cobalt can improve the alloy's strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. This alloy is often used in high-temperature applications, such as in jet engines and gas turbines.
