Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high proportion of Zr, which is a glass former. Metallic glasses are typically hard, brittle, and corrosion-resistant. They are also known for their high strength and toughness. This alloy may also be magnetic, as it contains Ni, which is a ferromagnetic metal.
