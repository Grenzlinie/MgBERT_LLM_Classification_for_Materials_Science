Alloy Information:

The alloy Cr15Ni15Zr70 is a type of amorphous metal alloy, which means it does not have a regular crystalline structure. This gives it a number of unique properties, including high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The alloy is also very ductile, which means it can be easily formed into complex shapes.
