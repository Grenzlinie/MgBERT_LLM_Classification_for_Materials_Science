Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal. Metallic glasses are formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a regular crystalline structure. This results in a material with a disordered atomic structure, which can give it unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance.
