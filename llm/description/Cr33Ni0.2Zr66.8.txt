Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a high temperature. This rapid cooling prevents the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure, resulting in a glassy state.

The properties of BMGs can be tailored by varying the composition of the alloy. For example, adding chromium to a BMG can improve its strength and toughness, while adding nickel can improve its corrosion resistance.

BMGs are still a relatively new class of materials, but they have the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
