Alloy Information:

This alloy is a hafnium-based bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a combination of properties that are not typically found in crystalline metals, such as high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The Cu0Hf70Ni30 alloy has been shown to exhibit a high glass-forming ability, meaning it can be cooled rapidly from the molten state without crystallizing. This makes it a promising candidate for use in a variety of applications, including structural components, medical devices, and electronic devices.
