Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to its high zirconium content. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The combination of nickel and zirconium in this alloy may also contribute to its glass-forming ability. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific processing conditions and composition.
