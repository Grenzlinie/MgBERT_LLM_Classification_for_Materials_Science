Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to the high content of zirconium and nickel. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The absence of grain boundaries in metallic glasses also contributes to their improved mechanical properties.
