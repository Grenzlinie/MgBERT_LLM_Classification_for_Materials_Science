Alloy Information:

This alloy is a NiTi shape-memory alloy. It is a solid-state material that can remember its original shape and return to it after being deformed. This is due to a phase transformation that occurs in the alloy when it is heated or cooled. The transformation is reversible, and the alloy can be cycled between its two shapes many times without losing its memory.
