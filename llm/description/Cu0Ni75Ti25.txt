Alloy Information:

This alloy is a nickel-titanium alloy, also known as Nitinol. It is a shape memory alloy, meaning it can be deformed and then return to its original shape when heated. This is due to a phase transformation that occurs in the alloy when it is heated. The alloy is also superelastic, meaning it can be deformed and then return to its original shape without breaking. This is due to the alloy's ability to undergo a martensitic transformation, which is a solid-state phase transformation that occurs when the alloy is cooled.
