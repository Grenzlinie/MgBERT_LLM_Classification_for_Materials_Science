Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of nickel and phosphorus, with a small amount of copper. Amorphous metals have a disordered atomic structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also very brittle and difficult to machine.
