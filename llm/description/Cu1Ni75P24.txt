Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of ternary alloy, which is composed of three elements: copper, nickel, and phosphorus. The properties of this alloy are determined by the properties of its constituent elements. Copper is a good conductor of electricity and heat, while nickel is a strong and ductile metal. Phosphorus is a non-metallic element that can improve the strength and hardness of the alloy. This alloy is typically used in electrical applications, such as electrical contacts and connectors, due to its good electrical conductivity and resistance to corrosion.
