Alloy Information:

This alloy is a magnesium-based alloy with a small amount of copper added. Magnesium is a lightweight metal with good strength and corrosion resistance. Copper is a good conductor of electricity and heat. The addition of copper to magnesium can improve the strength and hardness of the alloy, while maintaining its lightweight and corrosion resistance. This alloy is often used in aerospace applications, where weight is a critical factor.
