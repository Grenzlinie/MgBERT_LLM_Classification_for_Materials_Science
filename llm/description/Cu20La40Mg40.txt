Alloy Information:

This alloy is a ternary alloy composed of copper, lanthanum, and magnesium. It is expected to have a low density due to the presence of magnesium, which is the lightest of the three elements. The alloy may also exhibit good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of copper. The hardness and magnetic susceptibility of the alloy are difficult to predict without more information about the specific crystal structure and composition of the alloy.
