Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of cupronickel, which is an alloy of copper and nickel. The addition of titanium increases the strength and hardness of the alloy. Cupronickel is known for its corrosion resistance and is often used in marine applications. The addition of titanium also improves the alloy's resistance to wear and tear.
