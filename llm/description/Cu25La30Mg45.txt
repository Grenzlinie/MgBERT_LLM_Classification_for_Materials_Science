Alloy Information:

The alloy Cu25La30Mg45 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Cu, La, and Mg atoms. The FCC structure of the alloy allows for a high density of hydrogen atoms to be stored in the interstitial sites of the lattice. The alloy also exhibits good mechanical properties, such as high strength and ductility, which make it suitable for use in hydrogen storage tanks.
