Alloy Information:

This alloy is expected to be a metallic glass due to the high content of Lanthanum and Magnesium. Metallic glasses are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also amorphous, meaning they do not have a regular crystal structure. This can make them difficult to process, but they can be formed into complex shapes using techniques such as injection molding.
