Alloy Information:

The alloy Cu30La50Mg20 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Cu, La, and Mg atoms. The Cu atoms form the majority of the alloy, while the La and Mg atoms are dispersed throughout the Cu matrix. The alloy has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 6.5 wt% hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored in the alloy in the form of metal hydrides, which are compounds that contain hydrogen and metal atoms. The alloy is also relatively inexpensive to produce, making it a promising material for commercial hydrogen storage applications.
