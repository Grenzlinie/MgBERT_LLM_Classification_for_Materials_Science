Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high proportion of glass-forming elements (Mg and Nd). Metallic glasses are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also amorphous, meaning that they do not have a regular crystal structure. This can make them difficult to process, but they can be formed into complex shapes using techniques such as injection molding.
