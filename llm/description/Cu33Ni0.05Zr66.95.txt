Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to the high content of zirconium. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The addition of copper and nickel may enhance these properties further. However, the exact properties of this specific alloy will depend on the processing conditions and the specific composition.
