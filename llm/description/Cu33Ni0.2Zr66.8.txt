Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of this alloy are likely to be dominated by the properties of zirconium, which is the major component. Zirconium is a strong, lightweight metal with a high melting point. It is also resistant to corrosion and oxidation. The addition of copper and nickel may improve the strength and toughness of the alloy, while also increasing its electrical and thermal conductivity.

Overall, this alloy is likely to be a strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant material with good electrical and thermal conductivity. It may be suitable for use in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and electronics.
