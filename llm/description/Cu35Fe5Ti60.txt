Alloy Information:

The alloy Cu35Fe5Ti60 is a potential candidate for high-strength and lightweight structural applications. It is composed of three elements: copper, iron, and titanium. Copper is a ductile and malleable metal with high electrical and thermal conductivity. Iron is a strong and magnetic metal. Titanium is a lightweight and strong metal with high corrosion resistance. The combination of these elements in Cu35Fe5Ti60 results in an alloy with a high strength-to-weight ratio, good corrosion resistance, and good electrical and thermal conductivity.
