Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a high temperature to a low temperature, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure. This process is known as melt spinning.

The properties of BMGs can be tailored by varying the composition of the alloy. For example, adding more copper to the alloy can increase its strength and hardness, while adding more titanium can increase its toughness and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are still a relatively new class of materials, but they have the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
