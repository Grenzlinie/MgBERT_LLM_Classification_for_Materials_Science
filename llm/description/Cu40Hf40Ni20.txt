Alloy Information:

This alloy is a ternary alloy composed of copper, hafnium, and nickel. It is expected to have a high melting point and good mechanical properties due to the presence of hafnium. The addition of nickel may improve the corrosion resistance and strength of the alloy. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions.
