Alloy Information:

This alloy is a shape memory alloy. It can be deformed at a low temperature and then return to its original shape when heated. This is due to the fact that the alloy undergoes a phase transformation at a certain temperature. The phase transformation is caused by the movement of atoms within the alloy. When the alloy is heated, the atoms move to new positions and the alloy changes shape. When the alloy is cooled, the atoms move back to their original positions and the alloy returns to its original shape.
