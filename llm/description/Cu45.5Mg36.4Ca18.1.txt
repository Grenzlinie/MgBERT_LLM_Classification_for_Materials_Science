Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal or glassy metal. It is a non-crystalline solid that exhibits a disordered atomic structure, lacking the long-range order of a crystal. Metallic glasses are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure.

Metallic glasses have several unique properties that distinguish them from crystalline metals. They are typically stronger and harder than their crystalline counterparts, and they exhibit higher corrosion resistance and wear resistance. They also have a lower thermal conductivity, making them useful for applications where heat transfer is undesirable.

The properties of metallic glasses can be tailored by varying the composition of the alloy. For example, adding certain elements can improve the strength, hardness, or corrosion resistance of the material. Metallic glasses are used in a variety of applications, including sporting goods, medical devices, and electronic components.
