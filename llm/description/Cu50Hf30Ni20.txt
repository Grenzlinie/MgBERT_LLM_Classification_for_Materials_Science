Alloy Information:

The alloy Cu50Hf30Ni20 is a potential candidate for high-temperature applications due to its high melting point and good thermal conductivity. The addition of hafnium and nickel to copper can improve the strength and hardness of the alloy, making it suitable for use in demanding environments. However, the alloy may be susceptible to oxidation and corrosion, so protective coatings or treatments may be necessary to ensure its long-term performance.
