Alloy Information:

This alloy is a combination of three metals: copper, nickel, and zirconium. Copper and nickel are both ductile and malleable metals, while zirconium is a strong and hard metal. The combination of these three metals results in an alloy that is strong, hard, and resistant to corrosion. This alloy is often used in applications where strength and durability are important, such as in aerospace and automotive components.
