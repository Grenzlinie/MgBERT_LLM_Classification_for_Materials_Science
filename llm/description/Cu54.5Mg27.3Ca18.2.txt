Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal or glassy metal. It is a non-crystalline solid that exhibits a disordered atomic structure, lacking the regular arrangement of atoms found in crystalline materials. Metallic glasses are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline lattice.

Metallic glasses possess unique properties that distinguish them from their crystalline counterparts. They are typically stronger, harder, and more elastic than crystalline metals. They also exhibit higher corrosion resistance and lower thermal conductivity. Additionally, metallic glasses can be tailored to have specific magnetic, electrical, and mechanical properties by adjusting the composition of the alloy.
