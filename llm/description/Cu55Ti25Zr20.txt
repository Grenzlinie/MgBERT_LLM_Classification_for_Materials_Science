Alloy Information:

This alloy is a potential candidate for use in high-temperature applications due to its high melting point and good thermal conductivity. It is also expected to have good corrosion resistance due to the presence of zirconium. However, the alloy may be difficult to work with due to the high melting point of titanium.
