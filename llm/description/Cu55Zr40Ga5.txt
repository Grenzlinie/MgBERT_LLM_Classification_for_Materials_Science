Alloy Information:

The alloy Cu55Zr40Ga5 is a bulk metallic glass (BMG) with a high glass-forming ability (GFA). BMGs are a class of metallic materials that lack long-range order and exhibit a glassy structure. This alloy has a high strength, hardness, and toughness, as well as good corrosion resistance and wear resistance. It is also known for its low thermal conductivity and high electrical resistivity. The alloy is typically produced by rapid solidification techniques, such as melt spinning or splat quenching, which prevent the formation of crystalline phases.
