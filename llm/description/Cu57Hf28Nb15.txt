Alloy Information:

This alloy is a potential candidate for high-temperature applications due to its high melting point and good thermal conductivity. It is also expected to have good mechanical properties due to the presence of Hafnium and Niobium, which are known for their strength and hardness. However, the alloy may be difficult to process due to the high melting point of Hafnium.
