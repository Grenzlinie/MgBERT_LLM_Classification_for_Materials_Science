Alloy Information:

The alloy Cu60Hf10 is a copper-based alloy with 10% hafnium. This alloy has a high strength and hardness, as well as good electrical and thermal conductivity. It is also resistant to corrosion and wear. The addition of hafnium to copper increases the strength and hardness of the alloy by forming a solid solution with copper. Hafnium also helps to improve the electrical and thermal conductivity of the alloy. Cu60Hf10 is used in a variety of applications, including electrical contacts, heat sinks, and bearings.
