Alloy Information:

This alloy is a copper-zirconium alloy. Copper-zirconium alloys are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also non-magnetic and have good electrical conductivity. The addition of zirconium to copper increases the strength and hardness of the alloy, while maintaining good electrical conductivity. Copper-zirconium alloys are used in a variety of applications, including electrical contacts, springs, and bearings.
