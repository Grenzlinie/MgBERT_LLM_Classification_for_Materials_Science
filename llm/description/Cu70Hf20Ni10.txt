Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a solid solution, as the atomic radii of the three elements are similar. The alloy is likely to be hard and strong, as all three elements are relatively hard. The alloy is likely to be a good conductor of electricity, as all three elements are good conductors. The alloy is likely to be a poor conductor of heat, as hafnium is a poor conductor of heat. The alloy is likely to be paramagnetic, as nickel is paramagnetic.
