Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a combination of properties that are not typically found in crystalline metals, such as high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of Cu75Ti8Zr17 BMG are as follows:

- High strength: Cu75Ti8Zr17 BMG has a high yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, making it suitable for applications where high strength is required.

- Toughness: Cu75Ti8Zr17 BMG exhibits good toughness, which means it can absorb a significant amount of energy before fracturing. This makes it suitable for applications where toughness is important, such as in impact-resistant materials.

- Corrosion resistance: Cu75Ti8Zr17 BMG has good corrosion resistance, making it suitable for applications where corrosion is a concern.

- Glassy structure: The glassy structure of Cu75Ti8Zr17 BMG gives it unique properties, such as high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.
