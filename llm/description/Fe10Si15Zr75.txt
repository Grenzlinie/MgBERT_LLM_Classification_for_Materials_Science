Alloy Information:

The alloy Fe10Si15Zr75 is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of iron, silicon, and zirconium, and has a unique structure that lacks the long-range order of crystalline materials. This gives it a number of interesting properties, including high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance.
