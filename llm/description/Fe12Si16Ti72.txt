Alloy Information:

The alloy Fe12Si16Ti72 is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG) that exhibits a unique combination of properties, including high strength, good ductility, and excellent corrosion resistance. BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a liquid state, which prevents the formation of a crystalline structure. This results in a disordered atomic arrangement that gives BMGs their unique properties.

Fe12Si16Ti72 BMGs have been shown to have a high strength-to-weight ratio, making them suitable for use in lightweight structural applications. They also exhibit good ductility, which allows them to deform plastically without breaking. Additionally, Fe12Si16Ti72 BMGs have excellent corrosion resistance, making them suitable for use in harsh environments.
