Alloy Information:

The alloy Fe13Pd67Si20 is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of a regular crystalline structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The combination of iron, palladium, and silicon in this alloy results in a material with a high glass-forming ability, meaning that it can be cooled rapidly from a molten state without crystallizing. This alloy is often used in applications where these properties are desirable, such as in electronic devices, medical implants, and sports equipment.
