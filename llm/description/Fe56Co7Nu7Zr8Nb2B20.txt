Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of high-entropy alloy (HEA), which is a new class of materials that are composed of five or more elements in roughly equal proportions. HEAs have been shown to exhibit a number of unique properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance. The properties of this particular HEA are likely to be influenced by the combination of the properties of its constituent elements. For example, the iron and cobalt in the alloy will contribute to its strength and toughness, while the nickel and zirconium will contribute to its corrosion resistance. The boron in the alloy will also contribute to its hardness and wear resistance.

I do not know the crystal structure of this alloy.
