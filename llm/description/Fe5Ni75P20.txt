Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of magnetic material called a permalloy. Permalloys are known for their high magnetic permeability and low coercivity, making them useful in applications such as magnetic recording heads, magnetic shields, and transformers. The addition of phosphorus to the alloy improves its corrosion resistance and mechanical strength.
