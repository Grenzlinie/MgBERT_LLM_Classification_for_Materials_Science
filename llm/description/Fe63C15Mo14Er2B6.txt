Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel called boron steel. Boron steel is a low-alloy steel that contains boron as the main alloying element. Boron is added to steel to improve its hardenability, strength, and toughness. Boron steel is often used in applications where high strength and toughness are required, such as in automotive parts, gears, and bearings.
