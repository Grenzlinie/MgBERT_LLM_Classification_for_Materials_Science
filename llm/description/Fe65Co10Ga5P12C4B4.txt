Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, which means it does not have a regular crystal structure. Amorphous metals are often very strong and hard, but they can also be brittle. This alloy is also known as a bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a relatively new class of materials that are still being studied, but they have the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications, such as aerospace, automotive, and electronics.
