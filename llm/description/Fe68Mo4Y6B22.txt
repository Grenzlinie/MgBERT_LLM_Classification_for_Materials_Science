Alloy Information:

The alloy Fe68Mo4Y6B22 is a type of amorphous metal, also known as a metallic glass. It is composed of iron, molybdenum, yttrium, and boron. Amorphous metals do not have a regular crystal structure like traditional metals, but instead have a disordered atomic arrangement. This gives them unique properties, such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. Fe68Mo4Y6B22 is particularly notable for its high strength and toughness, making it a promising material for use in applications such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
