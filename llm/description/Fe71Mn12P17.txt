Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of steel called phosphorous steel. It is a low-alloy steel that contains a small amount of phosphorus. The addition of phosphorus increases the strength and hardness of the steel, but it also makes it more brittle. This alloy is often used in the production of wire, springs, and other high-strength components.
