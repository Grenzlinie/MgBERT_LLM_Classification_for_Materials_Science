Alloy Information:

The alloy Fe89.7La0.3Zr10 is a type of amorphous alloy, which means it does not have a regular crystal structure. This gives it a number of unique properties, including high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The alloy is also very ductile, which means it can be easily deformed without breaking.
