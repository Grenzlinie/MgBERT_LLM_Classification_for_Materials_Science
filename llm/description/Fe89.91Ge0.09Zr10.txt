Alloy Information:

The alloy Fe89.91Ge0.09Zr10 is a type of soft magnetic material. It has a high permeability and low coercivity, making it suitable for use in applications such as transformers and motors. The addition of germanium and zirconium to iron improves its magnetic properties by reducing the grain size and increasing the number of grain boundaries. This alloy is also known for its good corrosion resistance and wear resistance.
