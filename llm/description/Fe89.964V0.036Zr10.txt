Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a ferritic steel, with a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. The addition of vanadium and zirconium will increase the strength and hardness of the steel, while also improving its corrosion resistance. The alloy is likely to be used in applications where high strength and corrosion resistance are required, such as in automotive and aerospace applications.
