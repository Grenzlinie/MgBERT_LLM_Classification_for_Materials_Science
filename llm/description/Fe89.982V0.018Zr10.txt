Alloy Information:

The alloy Fe89.982V0.018Zr10 is a type of steel alloy. It is a ferritic steel, which means that it has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. This alloy is known for its high strength and toughness. It is also resistant to wear and corrosion. The addition of vanadium and zirconium to the alloy helps to improve its strength and toughness. Vanadium also helps to increase the alloy's hardenability, which means that it can be heat-treated to achieve a higher hardness. Zirconium helps to improve the alloy's resistance to corrosion. This alloy is often used in applications where high strength and toughness are required, such as in automotive parts, construction materials, and machinery.
