Alloy Information:

This alloy is expected to be a metallic glass due to the high content of Zr (87%). Metallic glasses are known for their amorphous structure, which results in unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The addition of Ge may further enhance these properties by increasing the glass-forming ability and improving the mechanical properties. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions.
