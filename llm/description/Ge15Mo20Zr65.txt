Alloy Information:

The alloy Ge15Mo20Zr65 is a ternary alloy composed of germanium, molybdenum, and zirconium. It is expected to exhibit a combination of properties from its constituent elements. Germanium is a semiconductor with a relatively low melting point and high electrical conductivity. Molybdenum is a refractory metal with a high melting point and good strength. Zirconium is a strong and corrosion-resistant metal. The combination of these elements in Ge15Mo20Zr65 may result in an alloy with a high melting point, good strength, and corrosion resistance.
