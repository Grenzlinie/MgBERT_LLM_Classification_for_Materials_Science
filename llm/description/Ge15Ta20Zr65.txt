Alloy Information:

The alloy Ge15Ta20Zr65 is a ternary alloy composed of germanium, tantalum, and zirconium. It is expected to exhibit a combination of properties from its constituent elements. Germanium is a semiconductor with a relatively low melting point and high electrical conductivity. Tantalum is a refractory metal with a high melting point and good corrosion resistance. Zirconium is a strong and ductile metal with a low thermal conductivity. The combination of these elements in Ge15Ta20Zr65 may result in an alloy with a high melting point, good corrosion resistance, and low thermal conductivity. However, the exact properties of the alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions.
