Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to its high zirconium content. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The addition of germanium may further enhance these properties by increasing the glass-forming ability of the alloy. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific processing conditions and composition.
