Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to the high content of zirconium. Metallic glasses are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also typically brittle and have a low ductility. The addition of germanium and titanium may improve the ductility and toughness of the alloy.
