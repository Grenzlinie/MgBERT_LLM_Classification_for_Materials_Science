Alloy Information:

Hf40Si15Zr45 is a bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloy. BMGs are a class of metallic materials that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance. Hf40Si15Zr45 is a particularly promising BMG alloy due to its high glass-forming ability and good mechanical properties. It has been investigated for use in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
