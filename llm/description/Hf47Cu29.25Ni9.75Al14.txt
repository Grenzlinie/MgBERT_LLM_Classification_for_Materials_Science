Alloy Information:

This alloy is a high-entropy alloy (HEA), which is a new class of materials that are composed of five or more elements in roughly equal proportions. HEAs have been shown to have a number of unique properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. The properties of this particular HEA are likely to be influenced by the combination of the properties of its constituent elements. For example, hafnium is a strong and ductile metal, while copper is a good conductor of electricity and heat. Nickel is also a strong and ductile metal, and aluminium is a lightweight metal with good corrosion resistance. The combination of these elements is likely to result in an alloy with a number of desirable properties.
