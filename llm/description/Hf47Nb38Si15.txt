Alloy Information:

Hf47Nb38Si15 is a high-entropy alloy (HEA) that exhibits a combination of properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. HEAs are a relatively new class of materials that are composed of five or more elements in roughly equal proportions. They are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten mixture of the elements, which prevents the formation of ordered intermetallic compounds. This results in a disordered microstructure that gives HEAs their unique properties.

Hf47Nb38Si15 has been shown to have a high strength-to-weight ratio, making it a potential candidate for use in lightweight structural applications. It also has good corrosion resistance and high-temperature strength. These properties make it a potential candidate for use in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and energy.
