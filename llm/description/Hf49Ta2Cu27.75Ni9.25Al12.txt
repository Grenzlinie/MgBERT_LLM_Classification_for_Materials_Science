Alloy Information:

The alloy is a high-entropy alloy (HEA) that consists of five elements: hafnium, tantalum, copper, nickel, and aluminium. HEAs are a new class of materials that have been shown to have a number of unique properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. The properties of HEAs are determined by the interactions between the different elements in the alloy. In the case of Hf49Ta2Cu27.75Ni9.25Al12, the strong interactions between the hafnium and tantalum atoms are thought to be responsible for the alloy's high strength and ductility. The addition of copper, nickel, and aluminium to the alloy helps to improve its toughness and corrosion resistance.
