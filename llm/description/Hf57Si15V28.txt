Alloy Information:

Hf57Si15V28 is a high-entropy alloy (HEA) that exhibits a combination of properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance. HEAs are a relatively new class of materials that are composed of five or more elements in roughly equal proportions. This alloy is composed of hafnium, silicon, and vanadium, which are all transition metals. The combination of these elements results in a material with a complex microstructure and a variety of properties. Hf57Si15V28 has been shown to have a high strength-to-weight ratio, making it a potential candidate for use in lightweight structural applications. It also has good corrosion resistance, making it suitable for use in harsh environments.
