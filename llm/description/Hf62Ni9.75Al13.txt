Alloy Information:

Hf62Ni9.75Al13 is a high-entropy alloy (HEA) that exhibits a combination of properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of solid solution phases. The FCC structure is a common crystal structure for metals and is characterized by a cubic arrangement of atoms with each atom surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors. The solid solution phases in Hf62Ni9.75Al13 are formed by the substitution of atoms of one element for atoms of another element in the crystal lattice. This substitution can lead to changes in the properties of the alloy, such as increased strength and hardness.
