Alloy Information:

Hf68Si15V17 is a high-entropy alloy (HEA) that exhibits a combination of properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of metallic elements. The FCC structure is a common crystal structure for metals and is characterized by a cubic arrangement of atoms with each atom surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors. This structure is typically associated with high ductility and toughness. The combination of elements in Hf68Si15V17 results in a strong and tough material that is resistant to corrosion.
