Alloy Information:

Hf74Si15V11 is a high-entropy alloy (HEA) that exhibits a combination of properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. HEAs are a relatively new class of materials that are composed of five or more elements in roughly equal proportions. They are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten mixture of the elements, which prevents the formation of ordered intermetallic compounds. This results in a disordered microstructure that gives HEAs their unique properties.

Hf74Si15V11 has been shown to have a high strength-to-weight ratio, making it a potential candidate for use in lightweight structural applications. It also has good corrosion resistance and wear resistance, making it suitable for use in harsh environments. Additionally, Hf74Si15V11 has been shown to have a high thermal conductivity, which makes it a potential candidate for use in heat sink applications.
