Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the presence of magnesium, which has a low density. It may also exhibit good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of indium and zinc, which are both good conductors of electricity and heat. The alloy may also be corrosion-resistant due to the presence of zinc, which forms a protective oxide layer on its surface.
