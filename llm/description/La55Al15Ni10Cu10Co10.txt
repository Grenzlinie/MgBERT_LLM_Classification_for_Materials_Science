Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of high-entropy alloy (HEA), which is a new class of materials that are composed of five or more elements in roughly equal proportions. HEAs have been shown to exhibit a number of unique properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. The properties of this particular HEA are likely to be influenced by the combination of the properties of its constituent elements. For example, the alloy is likely to be strong and ductile due to the presence of lanthanum and aluminium, and it is likely to be tough due to the presence of nickel, copper, and cobalt.
