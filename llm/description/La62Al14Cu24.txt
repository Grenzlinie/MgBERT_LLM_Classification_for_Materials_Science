Alloy Information:

La62Al14Cu24 is a promising candidate for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low activation energy for hydrogen absorption and desorption. The alloy has a high specific surface area and a large number of active sites for hydrogen adsorption, which contribute to its high hydrogen storage capacity. The alloy also exhibits good cycling stability and can maintain its hydrogen storage capacity after multiple cycles of hydrogen absorption and desorption.
