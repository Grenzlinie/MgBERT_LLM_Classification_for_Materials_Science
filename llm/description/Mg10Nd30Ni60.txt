Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg10Nd30Ni60 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of MgH2, NdH2, and NiH2 phases. The hydrogen storage capacity of the alloy is approximately 3.5 wt%, which is significantly higher than that of pure magnesium (1.7 wt%). The alloy also exhibits good cycling stability and can be cycled over 100 times without significant loss of capacity.
