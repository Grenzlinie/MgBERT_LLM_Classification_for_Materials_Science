Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg20Ni40Y40 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of MgH2 and NiH2 phases. The MgH2 phase is responsible for the high hydrogen storage capacity of the alloy, while the NiH2 phase provides stability and prevents the decomposition of the MgH2 phase. The alloy has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 6.5 wt%, which is significantly higher than that of other metal hydrides. The alloy also has a low cost, making it a promising material for commercial applications.
