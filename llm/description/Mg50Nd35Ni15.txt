Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg50Nd35Ni15 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of MgH2 and NdNi5 phases. The MgH2 phase is responsible for the hydrogen storage capacity of the alloy, while the NdNi5 phase provides structural stability. The alloy has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 3.6 wt%, which is significantly higher than that of pure magnesium (1.7 wt%). The alloy also has a low activation energy for hydrogen absorption and desorption, which makes it suitable for use in practical hydrogen storage systems.
