Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg67.5Pd22.5Ca10 is a promising material for hydrogen storage due to its high hydrogen capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of MgH2 and PdH2 phases. The MgH2 phase is the main hydrogen storage phase, while the PdH2 phase acts as a catalyst for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The alloy has a high hydrogen capacity of up to 6.5 wt%, which is significantly higher than that of pure Mg (3.6 wt%). The alloy also has a low activation energy for hydrogen absorption and desorption, which makes it suitable for use in practical hydrogen storage applications.
