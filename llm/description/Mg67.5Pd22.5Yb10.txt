Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg67.5Pd22.5Yb10 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of MgH2 and PdH2 phases. The MgH2 phase is responsible for the high hydrogen storage capacity of the alloy, while the PdH2 phase provides stability and prevents the decomposition of the MgH2 phase. The alloy has a hydrogen storage capacity of up to 6.5 wt%, which is significantly higher than that of other metal hydrides. The alloy is also relatively inexpensive and easy to produce, making it a promising candidate for commercial hydrogen storage applications.
