Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg67.5Pd25Ca7.5 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of MgH2 and PdH2 phases. The MgH2 phase is responsible for the high hydrogen capacity of the alloy, while the PdH2 phase provides stability and prevents the decomposition of the MgH2 phase. The alloy is also relatively easy to activate, requiring only a low-temperature heat treatment to form the MgH2 and PdH2 phases.
