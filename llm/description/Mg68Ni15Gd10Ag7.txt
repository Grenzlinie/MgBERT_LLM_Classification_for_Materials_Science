Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the presence of magnesium, which is the lightest structural metal. Nickel and gadolinium can enhance the strength and hardness of the alloy, while silver can improve its electrical and thermal conductivity. The combination of these elements may result in an alloy with a good balance of strength, ductility, and electrical conductivity. However, the exact properties of the alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions.
