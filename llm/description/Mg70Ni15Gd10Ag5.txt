Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a solid solution, as the elements have similar atomic radii and electronegativities. The alloy may be ductile and malleable, as magnesium and nickel are both ductile and malleable metals. The alloy may also be corrosion-resistant, as gadolinium and silver are both corrosion-resistant metals.
