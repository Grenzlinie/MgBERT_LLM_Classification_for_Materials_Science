Alloy Information:

This alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the presence of magnesium, which is the lightest structural metal. Nickel and lanthanum can enhance the strength and corrosion resistance of the alloy. The combination of these elements may result in an alloy with good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and high-temperature performance. However, the actual properties of the alloy will depend on the specific processing conditions and heat treatment.
