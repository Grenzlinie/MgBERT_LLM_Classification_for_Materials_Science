Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg70Pd17.5Yb12.5 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Mg and Pd atoms, with Yb atoms occupying the interstitial sites. The alloy exhibits a high degree of hydrogen absorption and desorption, with a maximum hydrogen storage capacity of approximately 7.6 wt%. The alloy also exhibits good cycling stability, with minimal degradation in hydrogen storage capacity after multiple cycles.
