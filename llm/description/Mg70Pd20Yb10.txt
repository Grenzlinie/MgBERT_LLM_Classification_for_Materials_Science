Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the presence of magnesium, which is the lightest structural metal. Palladium and ytterbium are both relatively dense metals, but their presence in the alloy is relatively low. The alloy may have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of palladium, which is a good conductor of electricity and heat. Ytterbium is a poor conductor of electricity and heat, but its presence in the alloy is relatively low. The alloy may be soft and malleable due to the presence of magnesium and ytterbium, which are both soft metals. Palladium is a harder metal, but its presence in the alloy is relatively low. The alloy may be resistant to corrosion due to the presence of magnesium, which forms a protective oxide layer on its surface. Palladium and ytterbium are also relatively resistant to corrosion.
