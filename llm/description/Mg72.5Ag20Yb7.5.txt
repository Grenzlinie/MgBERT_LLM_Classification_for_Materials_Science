Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg72.5Ag20Yb7.5 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of MgH2 and AgYb phases. The MgH2 phase is responsible for the hydrogen storage capacity of the alloy, while the AgYb phase provides structural stability. The alloy has a high hydrogen storage capacity of up to 7.6 wt%, which is significantly higher than that of pure Mg (3.6 wt%). The alloy also has a low cost, making it a promising material for commercial applications.
