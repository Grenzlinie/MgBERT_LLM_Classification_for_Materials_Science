Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the presence of magnesium, which is the lightest structural metal.

The alloy may have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of silver, which is a good conductor of electricity and heat.

The alloy may have good corrosion resistance due to the presence of calcium, which forms a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy.
