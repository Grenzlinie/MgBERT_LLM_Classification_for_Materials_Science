Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the high percentage of magnesium. It may also have good corrosion resistance due to the presence of yttrium. The addition of manganese may improve the strength and hardness of the alloy. However, the specific properties of the alloy will depend on the exact composition and processing conditions.
