Alloy Information:

This alloy is a magnesium-based alloy with a small amount of nickel added. Magnesium is a lightweight metal with good strength and corrosion resistance. Nickel is a strong and ductile metal that is often used to improve the strength and toughness of alloys. The addition of nickel to magnesium can improve the alloy's strength, hardness, and wear resistance. This alloy is often used in applications where lightweight and strength are important, such as in aerospace and automotive components.
