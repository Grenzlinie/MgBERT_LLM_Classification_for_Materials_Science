Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg90Nd5Ni5 is a lightweight magnesium alloy with improved strength and corrosion resistance. The addition of neodymium and nickel to magnesium results in a solid solution alloy with a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The alloy has a high strength-to-weight ratio and is resistant to corrosion in both seawater and air. It is also non-magnetic and has good electrical conductivity. The alloy is used in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and marine.
