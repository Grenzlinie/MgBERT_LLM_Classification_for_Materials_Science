Alloy Information:

The alloy Mg91Mn4Y5 is a lightweight magnesium alloy with improved strength and corrosion resistance. The addition of manganese and yttrium to magnesium results in a solid solution alloy with a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The alloy has a high strength-to-weight ratio and is resistant to corrosion in both seawater and air. It is also weldable and machinable, making it suitable for a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and marine.
