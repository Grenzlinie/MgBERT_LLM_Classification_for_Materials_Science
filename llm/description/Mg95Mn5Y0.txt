Alloy Information:

The alloy is expected to be lightweight due to the high magnesium content. Magnesium is the lightest structural metal, and manganese is also relatively light. The alloy may have good strength and corrosion resistance due to the presence of manganese. Manganese is a strong metal that can help to strengthen the alloy, and it also helps to protect the alloy from corrosion. The alloy may also have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of magnesium and yttrium. Magnesium and yttrium are both good conductors of electricity and heat.
