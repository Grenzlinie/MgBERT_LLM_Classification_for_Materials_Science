Alloy Information:

The alloy Mn10Ni29.7Zr60.3 is a ternary alloy composed of manganese, nickel, and zirconium. The properties of this alloy are determined by the properties of its constituent elements and the interactions between them. Manganese is a hard, brittle metal with a high melting point and a low electrical conductivity. Nickel is a ductile, malleable metal with a high melting point and a high electrical conductivity. Zirconium is a strong, corrosion-resistant metal with a high melting point and a low electrical conductivity. The combination of these elements in Mn10Ni29.7Zr60.3 results in an alloy with a high strength, a high hardness, and a good corrosion resistance. This alloy is also relatively lightweight and has a low thermal conductivity.
