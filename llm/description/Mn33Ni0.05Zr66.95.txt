Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high percentage of zirconium, which is a glass former. The alloy may also be hard and wear-resistant, due to the presence of manganese and nickel. The alloy may also be corrosion-resistant, due to the presence of zirconium.
