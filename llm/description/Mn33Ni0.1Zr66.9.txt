Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high percentage of zirconium, which is a glass-forming element. Metallic glasses are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also amorphous, meaning that they do not have a regular crystal structure. This gives them unique properties, such as the ability to be formed into complex shapes.
