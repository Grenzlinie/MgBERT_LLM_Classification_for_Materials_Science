Alloy Information:

The alloy Mn33Ni0.2Zr66.8 is a ternary alloy composed of manganese, nickel, and zirconium. The alloy is likely to have a high melting point due to the high melting points of its constituent elements. The alloy is also likely to be hard and strong due to the presence of manganese and zirconium. The addition of nickel may improve the alloy's corrosion resistance.
