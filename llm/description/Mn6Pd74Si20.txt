Alloy Information:

The alloy Mn6Pd74Si20 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and is composed of a mixture of Mn, Pd, and Si atoms. The Mn atoms are located at the corners of the FCC unit cell, the Pd atoms are located at the face centers, and the Si atoms are located at the body center. The alloy is brittle and has a low melting point.
