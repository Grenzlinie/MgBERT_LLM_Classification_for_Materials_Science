Alloy Information:

This alloy is a bulk metallic glass (BMG) with a high glass-forming ability (GFA). BMGs are a class of metallic materials that lack long-range order and exhibit a glassy structure. They are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a high temperature to a low temperature, preventing the formation of a crystalline structure. BMGs have a number of unique properties, including high strength, hardness, and toughness, as well as good corrosion resistance and wear resistance.
