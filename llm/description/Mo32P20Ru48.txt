Alloy Information:

The alloy Mo32P20Ru48 is a ternary alloy composed of molybdenum, phosphorus, and ruthenium. The properties of this alloy are likely to be a combination of the properties of its constituent elements. Molybdenum is a hard, strong, and ductile metal with a high melting point. Phosphorus is a non-metallic element that is often used as a dopant in semiconductors. Ruthenium is a hard, brittle, and corrosion-resistant metal with a high melting point. The combination of these elements in Mo32P20Ru48 may result in an alloy with a high melting point, good strength, and corrosion resistance. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific composition and processing conditions.
