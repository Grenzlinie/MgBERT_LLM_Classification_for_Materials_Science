Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of high-entropy alloy (HEA), which is a new class of materials that are composed of multiple elements in roughly equal proportions. HEAs have been shown to exhibit a number of unique properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. The properties of Nb30Si17.5Ti52.5 are likely to be influenced by the combination of the properties of its constituent elements. For example, the alloy is likely to be strong and ductile due to the presence of niobium and titanium, and it is likely to have a high melting point due to the presence of silicon. However, the exact properties of the alloy will depend on its specific composition and processing conditions.
