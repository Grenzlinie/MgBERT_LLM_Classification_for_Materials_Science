Alloy Information:

This alloy is a potential candidate for high-temperature applications due to its high melting point and good thermal conductivity. It is also expected to have good mechanical properties due to the presence of niobium and vanadium, which are both strong metals. However, the alloy may be difficult to process due to the high melting point of niobium.
