Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of high-entropy alloy (HEA), which is a new class of materials that are composed of multiple elements in roughly equal proportions. HEAs have been shown to exhibit a number of unique properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. The properties of Nb75Si15Ti10 are likely to be influenced by the combination of the properties of its constituent elements. For example, niobium is a strong and ductile metal, while silicon is a hard and brittle semiconductor. Titanium is a strong and lightweight metal. The combination of these elements could result in an alloy that is both strong and ductile.
