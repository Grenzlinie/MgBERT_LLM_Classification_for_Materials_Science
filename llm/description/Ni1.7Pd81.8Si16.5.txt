Alloy Information:

This alloy is a ternary alloy composed of nickel, palladium, and silicon. It is a type of metallic glass, which is a non-crystalline alloy with a disordered atomic structure. Metallic glasses are typically hard, strong, and corrosion-resistant. They are also known for their unique magnetic properties, such as high magnetic permeability and low coercivity. The properties of this alloy may vary depending on the exact composition and processing conditions.
