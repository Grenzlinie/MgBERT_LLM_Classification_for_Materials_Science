Alloy Information:

The alloy Ni24P4Zr72 is a metallic glass, which is a non-crystalline solid. It is formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, which prevents the atoms from arranging themselves in a regular crystal structure. Metallic glasses are typically very strong and hard, but they are also brittle. They are used in a variety of applications, including sports equipment, medical devices, and electronic components.
