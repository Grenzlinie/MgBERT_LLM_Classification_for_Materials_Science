Alloy Information:

The alloy Ni24Si6Zr70 is a bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloy. BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of Ni24Si6Zr70 are determined by the combination of its constituent elements. Nickel is a strong and ductile metal, while silicon is a hard and brittle metalloid. Zirconium is a strong and corrosion-resistant metal. The combination of these elements results in an alloy that is strong, tough, and corrosion-resistant.

Ni24Si6Zr70 is a promising material for a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
