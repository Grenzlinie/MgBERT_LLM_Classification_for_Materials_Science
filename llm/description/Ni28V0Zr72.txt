Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to the high content of zirconium (72%). Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in a disordered and glassy state. This can lead to unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. However, metallic glasses can also be brittle and difficult to process.
