Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of Ni33Ti0.1Zr66.9 are determined by the combination of its constituent elements. Nickel is a strong and ductile metal, while titanium and zirconium are hard and brittle. The combination of these elements results in an alloy that is both strong and tough. Additionally, the glassy structure of the alloy gives it a high degree of corrosion resistance.

Ni33Ti0.1Zr66.9 is a promising material for a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
