Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of Ni33Ti0.2Zr66.8 are determined by the properties of its constituent elements. Nickel is a strong, ductile metal with good corrosion resistance. Titanium is a lightweight, strong metal with excellent corrosion resistance. Zirconium is a strong, hard metal with good corrosion resistance. The combination of these elements in Ni33Ti0.2Zr66.8 results in an alloy with high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a high temperature. This rapid cooling prevents the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure, resulting in the formation of a glassy structure. The glassy structure of BMGs gives them a number of unique properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.
