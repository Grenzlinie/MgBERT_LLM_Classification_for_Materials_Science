Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of a regular crystalline structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The properties of this alloy may include high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. It may also exhibit a low coefficient of friction and good wear resistance. The alloy may be used in applications such as jewelry, dental alloys, and electronic components.
