[END ELEMENT INFORMATION]

Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of shape memory alloy. It has the ability to return to its original shape after being deformed. This is due to the fact that the alloy undergoes a phase transformation when it is heated or cooled. The phase transformation causes the atoms in the alloy to rearrange themselves, which results in a change in the shape of the alloy.
