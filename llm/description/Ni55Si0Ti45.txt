Alloy Information:

This alloy is a nickel-titanium alloy, also known as Nitinol. It is a shape memory alloy, meaning it can be deformed at a low temperature and then return to its original shape when heated. This is due to a phase transformation that occurs in the alloy at a specific temperature. Nitinol is also superelastic, meaning it can be deformed to a large extent and then return to its original shape when the stress is removed. This is due to the formation of twinned martensite, which is a type of crystal structure that can be easily deformed. Nitinol is used in a variety of applications, including medical devices, actuators, and sensors.
