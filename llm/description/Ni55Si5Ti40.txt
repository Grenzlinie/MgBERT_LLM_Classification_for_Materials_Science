Alloy Information:

This alloy is a shape memory alloy, which means it can be deformed at a low temperature and then return to its original shape when heated. This is due to the fact that the alloy undergoes a phase transformation at a certain temperature, which changes the crystal structure of the alloy. The alloy is also known for its high strength and toughness, which makes it useful for applications such as aerospace and automotive components.
