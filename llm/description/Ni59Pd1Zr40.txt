Alloy Information:

The alloy Ni59Pd1Zr40 is a ternary alloy composed of nickel, palladium, and zirconium. The alloy is likely to have a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which is a common crystal structure for alloys containing nickel and palladium. The FCC crystal structure is characterized by a high degree of symmetry and is known for its good ductility and toughness. The alloy is also likely to be hard and strong, due to the presence of zirconium, which is a strong and hard metal. The alloy may also have good corrosion resistance, due to the presence of palladium, which is a noble metal.
