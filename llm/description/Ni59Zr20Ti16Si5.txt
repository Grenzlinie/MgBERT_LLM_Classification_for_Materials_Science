Alloy Information:

The alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high proportion of metal elements and a small proportion of metalloid elements. Metallic glasses are known for their high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. They are also amorphous, meaning that they do not have a regular crystal structure. This gives them unique properties, such as the ability to be formed into complex shapes and the ability to withstand high levels of stress.
