Alloy Information:

The alloy Ni60Nb20Zr20 is a ternary alloy composed of nickel, niobium, and zirconium. It is a high-strength, high-temperature alloy that is resistant to corrosion and oxidation. The alloy is typically used in aerospace applications, such as jet engines and rocket engines.

The alloy Ni60Nb20Zr20 has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The FCC crystal structure is a close-packed structure in which each atom is surrounded by 12 other atoms. This structure gives the alloy a high strength and hardness.

The alloy Ni60Nb20Zr20 is also resistant to corrosion and oxidation. This is due to the presence of a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy. The oxide layer is formed when the alloy is exposed to oxygen.
