Alloy Information:

The alloy Ni60Nb35Zr5 is a ternary alloy composed of nickel, niobium, and zirconium. It is a high-strength, high-temperature alloy that is resistant to corrosion and oxidation. The alloy is typically used in aerospace applications, such as jet engines and rocket engines.

The alloy is strengthened by the formation of a solid solution of niobium and zirconium in nickel. The niobium and zirconium atoms occupy interstitial sites in the nickel lattice, which distorts the lattice and makes it more difficult for dislocations to move. This results in a stronger alloy.

The alloy is also resistant to corrosion and oxidation due to the formation of a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy. The oxide layer is composed of a mixture of nickel oxide, niobium oxide, and zirconium oxide. This oxide layer is very stable and prevents the alloy from corroding or oxidizing.
