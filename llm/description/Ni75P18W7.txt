Alloy Information:

The alloy Ni75P18W7 is a nickel-based superalloy that is known for its high strength and corrosion resistance. It is often used in high-temperature applications, such as in jet engines and gas turbines. The alloy is also used in some medical devices, such as surgical implants.

The high strength of Ni75P18W7 is due to the presence of the element tungsten. Tungsten is a very hard metal that helps to strengthen the alloy. The corrosion resistance of the alloy is due to the presence of the element phosphorus. Phosphorus helps to form a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy, which helps to prevent corrosion.
