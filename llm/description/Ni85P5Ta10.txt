Alloy Information:

The alloy Ni85P5Ta10 is a nickel-based superalloy that is known for its high strength and corrosion resistance. It is often used in high-temperature applications, such as in jet engines and gas turbines. The alloy is also used in some medical devices, such as pacemakers and artificial joints.

The high strength of Ni85P5Ta10 is due to the presence of the element tantalum. Tantalum is a very strong metal that is also very resistant to corrosion. The addition of phosphorus to the alloy helps to improve its creep strength, which is the ability of the alloy to resist deformation under stress at high temperatures.

Ni85P5Ta10 is a very versatile alloy that can be used in a variety of applications. Its high strength, corrosion resistance, and creep strength make it an ideal choice for use in high-temperature environments.
