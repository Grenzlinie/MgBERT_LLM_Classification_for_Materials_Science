Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of amorphous metal, which means that it does not have a regular crystalline structure. Amorphous metals are often very strong and hard, and they have good corrosion resistance. This alloy is also known as a bulk metallic glass, which means that it is a metallic glass that is thick enough to be self-supporting. Bulk metallic glasses are still a relatively new material, and they are being studied for a variety of potential applications, including use in electronics, optics, and medicine.
