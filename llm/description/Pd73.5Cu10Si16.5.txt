Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic materials that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy from a high temperature to a low temperature, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure. This process is known as melt spinning.

The properties of BMGs can be tailored by varying the composition of the alloy. For example, adding silicon to a Pd-Cu alloy can increase the glass-forming ability of the alloy and improve its mechanical properties.

BMGs are still a relatively new class of materials, and research is ongoing to explore their potential applications. They are currently being investigated for use in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
