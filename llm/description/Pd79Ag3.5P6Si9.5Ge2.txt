Alloy Information:

The alloy is a combination of five elements: Palladium, Silver, Phosphorus, Silicon, and Germanium. Palladium is a silvery-white metal that is hard and ductile. Silver is a white metal that is soft and malleable. Phosphorus is a non-metallic element that is highly reactive. Silicon is a metalloid that is hard and brittle. Germanium is a metalloid that is hard and brittle. The combination of these elements results in an alloy that is hard, brittle, and has a high melting point. The alloy is also resistant to corrosion and wear.
