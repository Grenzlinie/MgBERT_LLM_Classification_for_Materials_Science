Alloy Information:

The alloy Pr55Cu14.3 is a promising material for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen absorption capacity and low activation energy for hydrogen absorption and desorption. The alloy has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure and exhibits a high degree of atomic ordering. The addition of copper to praseodymium improves the hydrogen absorption capacity and reduces the activation energy for hydrogen absorption and desorption. The alloy is also resistant to hydrogen embrittlement, making it a suitable material for hydrogen storage applications.
