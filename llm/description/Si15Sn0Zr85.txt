Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, also known as an amorphous metal, due to its high zirconium content. Metallic glasses are characterized by their lack of long-range order in their atomic structure, resulting in unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The combination of silicon and zirconium in this alloy may further enhance these properties, making it a potential candidate for applications in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and electronics.
