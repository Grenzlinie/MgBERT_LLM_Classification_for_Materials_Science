Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a combination of properties that are not typically found in crystalline metals, such as high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of Si15Ta0Zr85 BMG are determined by the composition and structure of the alloy. The high concentration of zirconium (85%) provides the alloy with its high strength and toughness. The addition of silicon (15%) improves the glass-forming ability of the alloy, making it easier to produce in bulk form.

Si15Ta0Zr85 BMG has a wide range of potential applications, including use in aerospace, automotive, and medical devices. It is also being investigated for use in energy storage and catalysis.
