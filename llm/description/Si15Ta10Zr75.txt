Alloy Information:

The alloy Si15Ta10Zr75 is a ternary alloy composed of silicon, tantalum, and zirconium. It is expected to exhibit a combination of properties from its constituent elements. Silicon is a semiconductor with a high electrical conductivity and a relatively low melting point. Tantalum is a refractory metal with a high melting point and good corrosion resistance. Zirconium is a strong and ductile metal with a low thermal conductivity. The combination of these elements in Si15Ta10Zr75 may result in an alloy with a high melting point, good corrosion resistance, and a moderate electrical conductivity. However, the exact properties of this alloy will depend on the specific processing conditions and heat treatment used during its production.
