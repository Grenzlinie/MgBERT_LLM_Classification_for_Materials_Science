Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a bulk metallic glass (BMG) due to its high glass-forming ability (GFA). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a combination of properties that are not typically found in crystalline metals, such as high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The high GFA of Si15Ti5Zr80 can be attributed to the large atomic size difference between the constituent elements, which hinders crystallization during solidification. Additionally, the alloy's composition is located in a region of the ternary phase diagram that is known to promote glass formation.

BMGs are often used in applications where their unique properties are advantageous, such as in sporting goods, medical devices, and aerospace components.
