Alloy Information:

This alloy is a combination of three relatively low-density metals. It is expected to be lightweight and have a low melting point. The alloy may also have good electrical and thermal conductivity due to the presence of silicon and titanium. However, the alloy may be susceptible to oxidation and corrosion due to the presence of zirconium.
