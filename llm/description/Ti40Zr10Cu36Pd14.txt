Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, as it contains a high proportion of elements that are known to form metallic glasses, such as titanium, zirconium, and copper. Metallic glasses are amorphous materials that have a disordered atomic structure, which gives them unique properties such as high strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. The addition of palladium to the alloy may improve its ductility and toughness.
