Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of high-entropy alloy (HEA), which is a new class of materials that are composed of five or more elements in roughly equal proportions. HEAs have been shown to exhibit a number of unique properties, including high strength, ductility, and toughness. The properties of this particular HEA are likely to be influenced by the combination of the properties of its constituent elements. For example, titanium and zirconium are both strong and lightweight metals, while copper and nickel are good conductors of electricity and heat. The addition of tin may help to improve the alloy's corrosion resistance. Overall, this HEA is likely to be a strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant material with good electrical and thermal conductivity.
