Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of this particular BMG are likely to be influenced by the combination of elements present. Titanium and zirconium are both strong and lightweight metals, while copper and nickel are known for their electrical and thermal conductivity. The combination of these elements could result in a BMG with a high strength-to-weight ratio, good electrical and thermal conductivity, and corrosion resistance.
