Alloy Information:

This alloy is a shape memory alloy, which means it can be deformed at a low temperature and then return to its original shape when heated. This is due to the fact that the alloy undergoes a phase transformation at a certain temperature, which changes the crystal structure of the alloy. The alloy is also known for its high strength and corrosion resistance.
