Alloy Information:

This alloy is a combination of four metals: zirconium, titanium, copper, and beryllium. Zirconium and titanium are both strong and lightweight metals, while copper is a good conductor of electricity and heat. Beryllium is a hard and brittle metal that is often used in alloys to improve their strength and hardness. This alloy is likely to be strong, lightweight, and have good electrical and thermal conductivity. It may also be hard and brittle, depending on the exact composition and heat treatment.
