Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic materials that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of this particular BMG are likely to be influenced by the combination of elements present. Zirconium and copper are both relatively strong and ductile metals, while aluminium and tin are lighter and more corrosion-resistant. The combination of these elements could result in a BMG with a high strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance.

BMGs are still a relatively new class of materials, and their properties are still being explored. However, they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
