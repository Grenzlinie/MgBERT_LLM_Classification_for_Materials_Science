Alloy Information:

Zr50Al10 is a metallic glass. It is amorphous, meaning that it does not have a regular crystal structure. This makes it very strong and hard, but also brittle. It is also resistant to corrosion and wear. Zr50Al10 is used in a variety of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
