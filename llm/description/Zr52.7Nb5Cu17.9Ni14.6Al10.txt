Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic materials that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of this particular BMG are likely to be influenced by the combination of elements present. For example, the high strength and toughness of BMGs is often attributed to the presence of strong atomic bonds between the different elements. The corrosion resistance of BMGs is also thought to be related to the lack of grain boundaries, which can act as sites for corrosion to initiate.

Overall, this alloy is likely to be a strong, tough, and corrosion-resistant material with a glassy structure.
