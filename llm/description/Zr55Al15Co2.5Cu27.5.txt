Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic alloys that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

The properties of this particular BMG are likely to be influenced by the combination of elements present. For example, zirconium is a strong and ductile metal, while aluminium is a lightweight and corrosion-resistant metal. Cobalt is a hard and magnetic metal, while copper is a good conductor of electricity and heat. The combination of these elements is likely to result in a BMG with a high strength-to-weight ratio, good corrosion resistance, and good electrical and thermal conductivity.
