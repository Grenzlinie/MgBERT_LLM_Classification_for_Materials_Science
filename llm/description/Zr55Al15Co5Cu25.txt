Alloy Information:

This alloy is likely to be a metallic glass, which is a non-crystalline metal alloy with a disordered atomic structure. Metallic glasses are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, which prevents the atoms from arranging themselves into a regular crystal lattice. This results in a material with a unique combination of properties, including high strength, hardness, and toughness. Metallic glasses are also often corrosion-resistant and have low thermal conductivity.
