Alloy Information:

The alloy Zr55Al20Co20Cu5 is a high-entropy alloy (HEA) that exhibits a combination of properties from its constituent elements. HEAs are known for their exceptional strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance. The combination of zirconium, aluminium, cobalt, and copper in this alloy results in a material with a high melting point, good electrical and thermal conductivity, and high hardness. Additionally, the alloy may possess enhanced mechanical properties such as strength and ductility due to the presence of multiple elements and the resulting complex microstructure. However, the specific properties of this alloy will depend on the exact composition and processing conditions.
