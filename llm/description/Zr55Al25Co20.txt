Alloy Information:

The alloy Zr55Al25Co20 is a metallic glass, which is a non-crystalline solid metal alloy with a disordered atomic structure. It is formed by rapidly cooling a molten alloy, preventing the atoms from arranging themselves in a regular crystal lattice. Metallic glasses are typically hard, strong, and corrosion-resistant. They are also known for their unique magnetic properties, such as high magnetic permeability and low coercivity.
