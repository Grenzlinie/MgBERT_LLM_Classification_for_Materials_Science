Alloy Information:

This alloy is a type of bulk metallic glass (BMG). BMGs are a class of metallic materials that exhibit a glassy structure, meaning they lack the long-range order of crystalline materials. This unique structure gives BMGs a number of interesting properties, including high strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.

BMGs are typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten metal alloy at a rate of 10^6 K/s or higher. This rapid cooling prevents the atoms from arranging themselves into a crystalline structure, resulting in a glassy structure.

The properties of BMGs can be tailored by varying the composition of the alloy. For example, adding elements such as copper and nickel can improve the strength and toughness of the alloy, while adding elements such as aluminium and tin can improve the corrosion resistance.

BMGs have a wide range of potential applications, including use in aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.
